India Beat Lebanon 4-2 In Penalty Shootout To Enter SAFF Championship Final

Defending champions India held their nerves to beat Lebanon 4-2 in a tense penalty shootout after a goalless 120 minutes of play to enter the final of the SAFF Championship football in Bengaluru on Saturday.

Defending champions India held their nerves to beat Lebanon 4-2 in a tense penalty shootout after a goalless 120 minutes of play to enter the final of the SAFF Championship football in Bengaluru on Saturday. The home side face Kuwait, a 1-0 winner over Bangladesh in the other semifinal of the day, in the summit clash on July 4. India will be playing in the final of the regional tournament for the 13th time and ninth on the trot. They have won eight times in the earlier 13 editions. The only time India did not make it to the top two was in 2003. In the penalty shootout, skipper  ,  , Mahesh Singh and Udanta Singh found the back of the net for India. Lebanon could only score twice through Walid Shour and Mohammad Sadek. India goalkeeper Gurpreet Sandhu saved the kick from   while Khalil Bader's sailed above the crossbar. It was also India's second successive win over Lebanon after defeating them 2-0 in the recent Intercontinental Cup in Odisha. Before the late drama unfolded, the first half began with Lebanon dominating the proceedings. India were not even in the picture for the first 10 minutes. Lebanon had a brilliant chance to go ahead in the second minute. But   was a bit too eager to execute a volley, failing to impart direction as it sailed over the bar. India found their bearings soon and got their first crack at the opposition goal in the 16th minute. For once, Chhetri played the role of an orchestrator and pushed forward Jeakson Singh with a well-directed pass. Jeakson found Sahal Abdul Samad inside the box with a cross. However, Sahal's shot was parried away at the goal line by Ali Dhaini. Lebanon were the better side in the first half and they got another chance to take lead in the 42nd minute. However, captain Hassan Maatouk could not evade the stretched hands of Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Sandhu. Action continued to be at a furious pace in the second half as well. But both India and Lebanon could not break the deadlock. Both sides also defended well. Despite the midfield of both the teams showing a competitive streak, they failed to come up with a creative moment as the match meandered into the extra time. Chhetri could have scored twice in the 93rd and 95th minutes, but on both the occasions the Indian captain uncharacteristically could not find the target.


India Bank On Sunil Chhetri Magic To Overcome Lebanon Challenge In SAFF Championships Semis

India, the defending champions, entered the semis as the second-placed team behind Kuwait from Group A while Lebanon topped Group B in their march to the last-four stage.

India will bank on the striking prowess of their talismanic captain Sunil Chhetri to tame a formidable Lebanon in the SAFF Championship semifinal here on Saturday. India, the defending champions, entered the semis as the second-placed team behind Kuwait from Group A while Lebanon topped Group B in their march to the last-four stage. Chhetri has been India's primary weapon in this tournament, as he has so far netted five goals from three matches to sit on top of the goal-scorers' list. The count of goals includes a hat-trick against Pakistan. The sensational tumbling volley against Kuwait during India's last league match underlined his still burning desire to lead the team's charge. Chhetri will have to be on top of his game for India to hurdle over the Lebanon challenge, and this is not to say that others will have a lesser role. The likes of Sahal Abdul Samad, Mahesh Singh and Udanta Singh will have to up the ante to support their skipper. All of them have had their moments in the tournament but apart from Chhetri only Udanta and Mahesh have been able to find the target. India will be served well if they also can chip in with goals as relying on one player, even if he is as great as Chhetri, against an organised side like Lebanon could prove costly. The home side will also hope that their defence will continue to work like a well-oiled machine as they have conceded only one goal in the last nine matches. All these factors might not have lost on the Indians as Lebanon are a rather familiar opponent. The first meeting between these two sides took place in 1977 and since then they have engaged with each other seven more times. Overall, Lebanon hold a 3-2 edge over India with three matches ending in draws. However, India can take solace from the fact that their two recent outings against Lebanon fetched positive results. India held Lebanon to a goalless draw in the league match of the Intercontinental Cup earlier this month in Odisha, and beat them2-0 in the tournament final. But, then, past records have little meaning in the ultra-competitive world of football and India will have to be at their absolute best to beat their West Asian rivals, whose quick counter-attacks can be a thing of worry. They are entering the semis with an all-win record in the group stage, having warded off Bhutan, Maldives and Bangladesh. On the other hand, India were stretched by Nepal and Kuwait after a relatively easy outing against Pakistan. India will miss the presence of their head coach Igor Stimac on the touchline after the Croatian was slapped with his second red card of the tournament during the match against Kuwait. But then this India side has shown the penchant to rise over the rough sea, and the match against Lebanon will be another occasion for an encore. Saturday's matches: Kuwait vs Bangladesh, 3.30 PM, India vs Lebanon, 7.30 PM.


How Much Will Lionel Messi Earn In Inter Miami?

Lionel Messi is reportedly set to make his Inter Miami debut on July 21.

Argentina legend   has brought an end to his European adventure and is all set to play in the United States of America for Inter Miami. Messi reportedly had a lucrative offer on the table from Saudi Arabia but he decided to switch to the Major League Soccer instead. While the offer from the Middle East was extravegant, the money that Messi will be earning from his switch to MLS isn't bad by any means. However, Messi had himself confirmed that his move has nothing to do with money. "If it had been a matter of money, I'd have gone to Saudi Arabia or elsewhere," Messi had said when his move to MLS was confirmed. "It seemed like a lot of money to me. The truth is that my final decision goes elsewhere and not because of money." In total, Messi is said to have pocketed a USD 55 million salary from Inter Miami in the MLS. Here's the breakdown: : The figures have been reported by Sports entrepreneur Andre Petcash. Lionel Messi is set to be the highest-paid athlete on US soil. And his taxes will be steep: $55M: Salary  -  $20.35M: Federal Tax  $0: Florida Tax  $0: Agent Fee  $1.64M: Jock Tax  $1.29M: FICA/Medicare  =  $31.7M: Net Income  The   had earlier reported that the deal between Messi and Inter Miami is a complicated one, valued between $125 million and $150 million over the entire length of the 2 and half year contract. The overall package would include salary, bonuses as well as equity in the team. A profit-sharing model with Apple and Adidas is also said to be in place. "We are pleased that Lionel Messi has stated that he intends to join Inter Miami and Major League Soccer this summer," MLS said in a statement on Wednesday. "Although work remains to finalize a formal agreement, we look forward to welcoming one of the greatest soccer players of all time to our League." The 7-time Ballon d'Or winner, who completed football after winning the FIFA World Cup title with Argentina last year, is reportedly set to make his Inter Miami debut on July 21.


India Football Coach Igor Stimac Suspended For 2 Games, Fined USD 500 For Red Card Offence In SAFF Championship Game vs Kuwait

India head coach Igor Stimac was on Friday handed a two-match ban for his red-card offence after he argued with the match officials during the home side's 1-1 draw against Kuwait in their last group match of the SAFF Championships

India head coach Igor Stimac was on Friday handed a two-match ban for his red-card offence after he argued with the match officials during the home side's 1-1 draw against Kuwait in their last group match of the SAFF Championships football in Bengaluru. Stimac was also fined USD 500 as the SAFF Disciplinary Committee deemed it a fit case for suspending him for more than one match. He was also handed a red card against Pakistan in India's campaign opener on June 21 but in that case the matter was not referred to the SAFF Disciplinary Committee as the offence was deemed "less serious" and he had to sit out of the subsequent match against Nepal on June 24. But in this case relating to the red card in the Kuwait game on June 27, the matter reached the SAFF Disciplinary Committee which imposed a more severe punishment on the experienced Croatian coach and 1998 Wold Cup bronze medallist. "He (Stimac) has been handed two-match ban and also fined USD 500 (Rs 41,000)," SAFF General Secretary General Anwarul Haq told PTI on Friday. "Unlike the first instance (against Pakistan), the matter reached the SAFF Disciplinary Committee as it was a graver offence. He (Stimac) also used abusive language against the math officials while he was going off the field (after being shown red card)." In the tense match against Kuwait, Stimac engaged in an animated argument with the match officials and was eventually flashed a red card in the 81st minute. In any case, Stimac was to sit out of India's semifinal match against Lebanon on Saturday as one match ban was automatic but now he will not be in the dug out if the home team reaches the final. Assistant coach Mahesh Gawli will have to take his place.


PSG Coach Christophe Galtier Arrested In Discrimination Probe

Christophe Galtier is set to be fired by the Qatari owners of PSG after a largely underwhelming season in which PSG suffered 10 defeats in 2023, exiting the Champions League, the team's main objective, in the last 16.

Paris Saint Germain coach Christophe Galtier was held for questioning along with his son as part of a probe into alleged discrimination, the Nice prosecutor told AFP on Friday. The move follows an investigation launched in April, following claims he made racist and Islamophobic remarks about players when he coached Nice in the 2021/22 season. The prosecutor said they would provide more information on the arrests of Galtier and his son John Valovic-Galtier -- a player's agent -- via a statement later on Friday. Galtier is set to be fired by the Qatari owners of PSG after a largely underwhelming season in which PSG suffered 10 defeats in 2023, exiting the Champions League, the team's main objective, in the last 16. The allegations first surfaced in the French media in April. The reports -- which AFP was unable to verify -- alleged that ex-Nice sporting director Julien Fournier had written an email at the end of the 2021/22 season in which he claimed Galtier had made discriminatory remarks at several members of the Nice squad. "He (Galtier) told me that I should take account of the reality of the city and that in effect we should not have as many blacks and Muslims in the team," claimed Fournier, whose relationship with Galtier was a fraught one. "He told me he wanted to profoundly change the team's make-up and limit the maximum number of Muslims." Galtier said he was "deeply shocked by the claims" and denied the allegations. He launched a defamation suit of his own against the journalist who published the claims and Fournier. Fournier indicated to AFP on May 22 he had been questioned as part of the judicial enquiry without giving any further details. Several players and directors, including the club president  -Pierre Rivere, and former coach   were also questioned by investigators. The message was reportedly sent by Fournier -- whose relationship with Galtier was tense -- to Dave Brailsford, the former head of British Cycling and Team Sky now the Director of Sport at Ineos, the owners of Nice. Galtier and Fournier both left Nice last year after working together at the club for one season, with the former being appointed by PSG.


Kylian Mbappe And Les Bleus Call For End To Violence In France

France captain Kylian Mbappe and Les Bleus urged an end to violence and called for "dialogue and reconstruction" on Friday as France was hit by a fourth night of protests after the fatal police shooting of a teenager

France captain   and Les Bleus urged an end to violence and called for "dialogue and reconstruction" on Friday as France was hit by a fourth night of protests after the fatal police shooting of a teenager. "The time of violence must give way to that of mourning, dialogue and reconstruction," the team said in a statement posted on social media by the Paris Saint-Germain superstar. Les Bleus said they were "shocked by the brutal death of young Nahel" but asked that violence give way to "other peaceful and constructive ways of expressing oneself". Clashes with police have shaken many cities and neighbourhoods across France since the death of 17-year-old Nahel, who was shot dead on Tuesday by a police officer during a traffic stop in a Paris suburb. "Since this tragic event, we have witnessed the expression of popular anger, the substance of which we understand, but the form of which we cannot endorse," the French football team said in the message shared on their personal social media accounts. The players said they share "these feelings of pain and sadness" but "it is your property that you are destroying, your neighborhoods, your cities, your places of fulfilment". "In this context of extreme tension, we cannot remain silent and our civic conscience encourages us to call for appeasement, awareness and accountability," they said. "There are other peaceful and constructive ways of expressing ourselves. This is where our energies and our thoughts must be focused". In a separate message sent to followers of the France team, coach Didier Deschamps "welcomed" the initiative of the players. "My staff and I are associated with it," he said. "We also have a thought for Nahel's family. However, without wanting to give lessons to anyone, I have the deep conviction that violence has never solved anything. I hope with all my heart that the situation will improve," he said.


France Forward Marcus Thuram Signs For Inter Milan

Son of 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, the 25-year-old signed a five-year deal with last season's Champions League finalists worth a reported 6.5 million euros ($7.1 million) a season

French international striker Marcus Thuram signed for Inter Milan on a free transfer on Saturday, the Serie A club announced. Son of 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, the 25-year-old signed a five-year deal with last season's Champions League finalists worth a reported 6.5 million euros ($7.1 million) a season. Inter secured his services on the back of his most successful season for Bundesliga side Borussia Moenchengladbach in which he scored 13 goals -- he became a free agent at the end of the campaign. "Marcus Thuram signs for Inter," read a statement on the club's website. "The forward, who was born in 1997, joins the Nerazzurri following four seasons with Borussia Moenchengladbach." Thuram will play up front alongside   after picking the country of his birth rather than Paris Saint-Germain, replacing veteran   who signed for Turkish giants Fenerbahce last week. He was born in Parma where his father played for five seasons, winning the UEFA Cup and Italian Cup in 1999 as part of a star-studded outfit which also featured Italian icons   and   Cannavaro. Buffon and Cannavaro got the better of Thuram senior at the 2006 World Cup, beating France in the final on penalties. Thuram senior had wanted his son to take up either fencing or judo but he defied his father. Thuram junior also suffered World Cup heartache at the hands of Martinez and Argentina in last December's thrilling World Cup final. France lost on penalties following a thrilling 3-3 draw in which they were 2-0 behind at half-time, with 10-times capped Thuram setting up the equaliser which took the game to extra-time. Thuram may yet have to battle with   for a place in Inter's starting line-up, as the Belgium striker is in discussions to stay in Milan despite his loan from Chelsea ending this week.


Ex-Man City Star Benjamin Mendy Said He Slept With 10,000 Women, Court Told At His Retrial

Benjamin Mendy, who is now a free agent, joined Manchester City from French club Monaco in 2017.

Manchester City defender  , who is being retried on one charge of rape and one of attempted rape, has reportedly claimed, as per multiple British media outlets, that he had slept with 10,000 women. Mendy, whose contract with Manchester City expired on Saturday, is accused of attacking the woman, aged 24 at the time, at his mansion in Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, in October 2020. Accoring to reports in the   and  , Mendy allegedly raped a young woman then told her "it's fine, I've had sex with 10,000 women". However, Mendy, a World Cup winner with France in 2018, has denied both claims. During his last trial which took place in January earlier this year, the jurors had failed to reach a conclusion on the two charges involving two different women. After the end of his trial in January, the judge at the Chester Crown Court had told the jury of six women and six men that Mendy was found not guilty of the offences alleged by other women. However, the judge had immediately set a new trial date of Monday, June 26, for the two counts on which the jury did not return a verdict. Mendy, who is now a free agent, joined Manchester City from French club Monaco in 2017. He has played 75 times for City, but his playing time was limited by injuries and a loss of form. He has not played since August 15 2021 -- days before he was hit with an initial charge of four counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. The last of his 10 caps for France came in November 2019, after the defender won the World Cup in 2018. (With AFP Inputs)


SAFF Championship: India To Face Lebanon In Semifinal

Lebanon set up a semifinal clash against hosts India with a 1-0 win over Maldives in a Group B match of the SAFF Championship in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

Lebanon set up a semifinal clash against hosts India with a 1-0 win over Maldives in a Group B match of the SAFF Championship in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Skipper   struck the all-important goal with his curling freekick in the 24th minute. Lebanon have topped the group with an all-win record in the four-team group. Lebanon will take on India in the battle for the summit clash on Saturday. The two teams met recently in the final of the Intercontinental Cup in Bhubaneswar, where India emerged the winners. The Maldives, ranked 154 in the FIFA Men's rankings, were hoping to punch above its weight by winning against Lebanon, whom they have never beaten in previously. Having already sealed their last-four berth, Lebanon head coach Aleksandar Ilic rested a few of his regular players including Karim Darwich. Lebanon started the match on a positive note, keeping plenty of possession and trying to stretch the Maldives defence. The deadlock was finally broken when Lebanon was awarded a free kick a few metres outside the penalty box. Maatouk stepped up to curl in a right-footed shot past Maldives custodian Hussain Shareef. Hussain was left wrong-footed after Hassan's shot took a deflection and went in. The Maldives defence were struggling to cope with Lebanon's constant surge during this spell. Hassan Maatouk combined well with Mohamad Sadek and Zein Al Abidine Farran to create havoc in the rival area. Moments after the first goal, Lebanon squandered a golden opportunity to extend their lead when Mohamad Sadek missed from a close range. He shot well over the crossbar following Zein Al Abidine Farran's brilliant pass from the right. Farran created another opportunity for Lebanon as he chipped in a cross from the right to find Hassan Maatouk but his header lacked power to beat Hussain Shareef in goal. Maldives, on the other hand, failed to have a shot on target and Lebanon goalkeeper   was never tested. Lebanon tried to extend their lead in the second half and had it not been for Hussain Shareef under the bar, the Maldives would have conceded a few more goals. He saved two brilliant attempts from Ali Al Haj in the second half to keep the Maldives in the game. The Maldives finished their SAFF Championship campaign with only one win in three matches.


Kuwait Beat Bangladesh 1-0 To Enter SAFF Championship Final

Kuwait had to stretch their last sinew before eking out a nervy 1-0 win over Bangladesh to enter the SAFF Championship final in Bengaluru on Saturday

Kuwait had to stretch their last sinew before eking out a nervy 1-0 win over Bangladesh to enter the SAFF Championship final in Bengaluru on Saturday. Abdullah Al Bloushi scored the winner for Kuwait in the dying minutes of the first half of extra time. They will face either India or Lebanon in the summit clash on July 4. Before the goal, the match saw both the sides frittering away chances with abandon. It started in the second minute of the first half itself when Bangladesh's Shekh Morsalin only had Kuwait goalkeeper Anisur Rahman to beat but shot the ball straight into the latter's hands. Kuwait were not far behind either. Mobarak Al Faneeni made a header into an open goal but there was no real power in it as a Bangladesh defender cleared the ball near the line. As the match progressed, the tussle for superiority intensified without a clear winner emerging. Even amid that clash of equals, Bangladesh's veteran striker Rakib Hossain shone brightly with his quick invasions of the rival box. Rakib was very close to putting Bangladesh ahead as well. He had made blazing shots twice in the beginning of the second half and in the 61st minute. But Kuwait custodian Abdul Rahman and the crossbar denied him on both the occasions. Just as the match seemed to be heading towards a shootout, Ahmad Al Dhefeery freed Al Bloushi with a clever pass. Al Bloushi did not fail to find the net this time, breaking Bangladesh hearts. Bangladesh tried gamely in the second half that saw some heated moments involving players and match officials. But Kuwait managed to hang on. PTI UNG ATK ATK


Tottenham Hotspur Buy James Maddison From Relegated Leicester

Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday completed the signing of creative midfielder James Maddison from relegated Leicester in a deal worth 40 million pounds

Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday completed the signing of creative midfielder   from relegated Leicester in a deal worth 40 million pounds (46.3m euros) plus add-ons. The 26-year-old England international signed a five-year deal. Maddison began his career with Coventry City before joining Norwich City in January, 2016. He moved to Leicester in 2018 and in five seasons made 203 appearances, scored 55 goals and helped win the FA Cup. He scored 10 goals last season as Leicester were relegated from the Premier League. He has three England caps. Maddison's creativity will boost a Spurs squad that has lacked a player in his mould since   left in 2020. He is the club's third signing of the summer. Winger Dejan Kulusevski's loan switch from Juventus was made permanent and goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario joined from another Italian club, Empoli. Speculation continues to swirl around Tottenham's star striker   who is entering the last year of his contract. Bayern Munich have agreed personal terms with the England captain, German daily Bild reported Wednesday, but an initial 70-million-euro bid was rejected by Tottenham. Kane's camp is believed to have approved the move, but Bayern need an agreement on a fee with Tottenham to seal the transfer. Bayern submitted an offer of 70 million euros plus add-ons for Kane, according to Bild, while Spurs are demanding at least 100 million euros to part with their talismanic striker.


Arsenal Sign Kai Havertz From Chelsea On 'Long-Term Contract'

Neither club disclosed a fee but British media said Arsenal were paying Chelsea 65 million pounds or 75 million euros.

Arsenal on Wednesday signed German attacking midfielder   from Chelsea on a "long-term contract". Neither club disclosed a fee but British media said Arsenal were paying Chelsea 65 million pounds or 75 million euros.  He is Arsenal's first signing of the summer but the British press reported the club had agreed a 105 million-pound fee for West Ham's England midfielder  . Havertz joined Chelsea in 2020 from Bayer Leverkusen. He made 139 appearances in three seasons, scoring 32 times, including the only goal in the 2021 UEFA Champions League final victory over Manchester City. Arsenal were runners up in the Premier League last season while Chelsea, rebuilding their squad, were 12th. "The mentality in the Arsenal squad is very high and you can feel that. That was one of the reasons why it has been so hard to play against Arsenal recently," Havertz told the Arsenal web site. "The aim is to win trophies and I'm going to give everything to do that." He posted a farewell message to Chelsea on social media. He said he was writing "with a heavy heart...saying goodbye to the club that has become my second home, and to the incredible fans who have supported me throughout this amazing journey." Arsenal boss   said: "Kai is a player of top quality. He has great versatility and is an intelligent player. He will bring a huge amount of extra strength to our midfield and variety to our play."


"It May Come On A Day When...": India Football Great Sunil Chhetri Opens Up On "Last Game For The Country"

Sunil Chhetri is 38 but still continues to be the spearhead of Indian attack, evidenced by the five goals he netted in the ongoing SAFF Championship from three matches

India skipper and mercurial striker   on Friday played down the talks about his retirement saying he has not put any timeline for himself to bid adieu to the game. Chhetri is 38 but still continues to be the spearhead of Indian attack, evidenced by the five goals he netted in the ongoing SAFF Championship from three matches. "I don't know when my last game for the country is going to be. It derives from the fact that I have never had long-term targets, I think about next match, next 10 days. It (retirement) may come at a day when probably I don't want to, as there are a lot of things, and I will be done. Till that time, I never think about it," Chhetri said on the eve of India's semifinal against Lebanon. Chhetri, the second highest goal-scorer from Asia with 91 goals, said he has set some parameters for himself to determine about hanging his boots. "Generally, there are some parameters that I think about... whether I am contributing to the team or not, whether I am able to score goal or not, training as hard as I want or not. These are some of the markers that will tell me whether I am good for this team or not. The day I see that it is not there, I am done, I am gone because there is not any other motivation for me to play. "But sadly, I can't tell whether it (retirement) is in one year or six months. Fortunately or unfortunately my family is also guessing this, and whenever they mention this, jokingly, I tell my stats to them. The day I am finished with my petrol or diesel or electric or whatever I am done," said Chhetri. Chhetri said Lebanon are a tough side and taking them for granted might backfire. He did not read too much into India's 2-0 victory over Lebanon in the recent Intercontinental Cup final. "Lebanon is a tough side. We have already played them twice. I'm pretty sure they have the same feeling about us and trying to stay calm. We did our best to recuperate after so many games in such short time," said Chhetri. India's assistant coach Mahesh Gawli said the team is motivated and ready for the big test against Lebanon. "Lebanon is a good side and we are prepared for the fight. The boys are motivated, the boys are committed, focused and will continue to the show the same metal which we showed in the previous matches," said Gawli.


Former Barcelona Boss Gerardo Martino Named Inter Miami Head Coach

Gerardo Martino will take over the team, from interim Javier Morales, once his work documentation has been completed.

Inter Miami have appointed former Barcelona and Argentina coach Gerardo Martino to take charge of the Major League Soccer team, setting up a reunion with compatriot  . Martino, widely known as "Tata," coached Messi with both the Spanish club and his country's national team. He was most recently in charge of Mexico and previously worked in MLS with Atlanta United, winning the title in 2018. Martino's arrival was widely expected after Miami, rock bottom of the Eastern Conference, fired their English coach Phil Neville. The 60-year-old will take over the team, from interim Javier Morales, once his work documentation has been completed. "We are very happy to be able to welcome Tata to Inter Miami. We feel he is a coach who matches our ambitions as a club and we're optimistic about what we can accomplish together," said Inter Miami Managing Owner Jorge Mas. "Tata has coached at the highest levels and we believe that experience will be hugely beneficial to us as we aim to compete for titles here," he added. Messi said earlier this month that he was joining Miami, co-owned by  , having opted to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of his contract. The 60-year-old Martino played for and coached Argentine club Newell's Old Boys, where Messi played as a schoolboy. "Tata is a highly respected figure in our sport whose track record speaks for itself," said Beckham. "We are confident that his achievements in the game and experience as a head coach will inspire our team and excite our fans and look forward to seeing the impact he will have on and off the field". The South Florida club also expect to complete the signing of another of Martino's former charges at Barcelona, Spanish midfielder   and Mas has indicated Miami could bring in as many as five players during the summer transfer window. Martino has been out of work since his contract with Mexico ended after a disappointing World Cup campaign where El Tri failed to get out of the group stage. "I'm very excited to join a big club like Inter Miami and I know together we can accomplish many great things," said Martino. "The club has the necessary infrastructure to be a major competitor in the region and I believe that with everyone's hard work and commitment we can get there," he said. Martino made his mark as a coach in Paraguay, leading the national side to the runners-up spot in the 2011 Copa America. After impressing at Newell's he had a season in charge of Barca in 2013-14 before taking over the Argentine national side for two years and then joined Atlanta in 2016. Martino will also be re-united with Venezuelan striker Josef Martinez whose 31 goals in 2018 were crucial to Atlanta's MLS Cup triumph.

Messi And Busquets Not Moving To Miami For a Holiday, Says Martino

Martino, former coach of Messi with Barcelona and Argentina, said he had spoken to the seven-times Ballon d'Or winner and former Spain midfielder Busquets about their impending move to the Major League Soccer club

Newly appointed Inter Miami coach Gerardo Martino says there is no question of   and   moving to South Florida to chill on South Beach. Instead, says the Argentine who was appointed on Wednesday, the pair are coming to Miami to fight for titles. Martino, former coach of Messi with Barcelona and Argentina, said he had spoken to the seven-times Ballon d'Or winner and former Spain midfielder Busquets about their impending move to the Major League Soccer club. "Sometimes in our world you associate United States and Miami with holidays. And it's not that. They are coming to compete," he told a press conference on Thursday. "They are coming from winning world titles, Spanish league titles. They are not going to relax. They will compete because it is in their blood," he said. Martino takes over Miami with the club bottom of the Eastern Conference having lost their last seven games. They are ranked 27th out of the 29 clubs in MLS. The former Mexico and Atlanta United coach said there was still the chance to salvage something from this season, however. "One is to see if we can make the playoffs. Right now that seems like a stretch, but as long as we have the possibility we can't stop trying," he said. "We are in a good place in the US Open Cup, and now there's a new tournament, Leagues Cup, that we will aim for. After that, the goal is to build for 2024," added the coach known as 'Tata'. Sporting Director Chris Henderson said the club would be making more changes to their squad in the coming weeks "Come late August we're going to have a different look. This will give the opportunity for Tata and his staff to work with the players in a new way. "It feels like a new beginning for the club and we're going to do everything we can to rise up the table game by game," he added. Martino won MLS Cup in 2018 with Atlanta United and said he was well aware of what awaited him in the North American league. "I see a league that is always evolving, a league that has a lot of rules, but they are very clear," he said. "It is very level for all the teams, the system of budgets and draft allows all teams at the start to have the same aspirations. "I like the complexity of the cold of one place, rain of another, heat of another. All that makes you as a coach have to think about more than just managing what happens on the field," he said. But Martino believes Messi will transform MLS. "That the world's greatest player decides to play in this league, evidently it will open an even greater scenario of growth," he said.

The match entered into penalty shootout as none of the teams could score any goal even in the regulation time as well as the extra-time. The score remained 0-0. The Blue Tigers made some good attack, however, they lacked execution. On the other hand, Lebanon too faltered in finishing but they did well back at their own box to negate India's attack. In the penalty shootout, Sunil Chhetri's goal in the first attempt and Gurpreet Singh Sandhu's save put India 1-0 ahead of Lebanon before the hosts eventually won it 4-2.


India Beat Lebanon 4-2 In Penalty Shootout To Enter SAFF Championship Final

Defending champions India held their nerves to beat Lebanon 4-2 in a tense penalty shootout after a goalless 120 minutes of play to enter the final of the SAFF Championship football in Bengaluru on Saturday.

Defending champions India held their nerves to beat Lebanon 4-2 in a tense penalty shootout after a goalless 120 minutes of play to enter the final of the SAFF Championship football in Bengaluru on Saturday. The home side face Kuwait, a 1-0 winner over Bangladesh in the other semifinal of the day, in the summit clash on July 4. India will be playing in the final of the regional tournament for the 13th time and ninth on the trot. They have won eight times in the earlier 13 editions. The only time India did not make it to the top two was in 2003. In the penalty shootout, skipper  ,  , Mahesh Singh and Udanta Singh found the back of the net for India. Lebanon could only score twice through Walid Shour and Mohammad Sadek. India goalkeeper Gurpreet Sandhu saved the kick from   while Khalil Bader's sailed above the crossbar. It was also India's second successive win over Lebanon after defeating them 2-0 in the recent Intercontinental Cup in Odisha. Before the late drama unfolded, the first half began with Lebanon dominating the proceedings. India were not even in the picture for the first 10 minutes. Lebanon had a brilliant chance to go ahead in the second minute. But   was a bit too eager to execute a volley, failing to impart direction as it sailed over the bar. India found their bearings soon and got their first crack at the opposition goal in the 16th minute. For once, Chhetri played the role of an orchestrator and pushed forward Jeakson Singh with a well-directed pass. Jeakson found Sahal Abdul Samad inside the box with a cross. However, Sahal's shot was parried away at the goal line by Ali Dhaini. Lebanon were the better side in the first half and they got another chance to take lead in the 42nd minute. However, captain Hassan Maatouk could not evade the stretched hands of Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Sandhu. Action continued to be at a furious pace in the second half as well. But both India and Lebanon could not break the deadlock. Both sides also defended well. Despite the midfield of both the teams showing a competitive streak, they failed to come up with a creative moment as the match meandered into the extra time. Chhetri could have scored twice in the 93rd and 95th minutes, but on both the occasions the Indian captain uncharacteristically could not find the target.


Ex-Man City Star Benjamin Mendy Said He Slept With 10,000 Women, Court Told At His Retrial

Benjamin Mendy, who is now a free agent, joined Manchester City from French club Monaco in 2017.

Manchester City defender  , who is being retried on one charge of rape and one of attempted rape, has reportedly claimed, as per multiple British media outlets, that he had slept with 10,000 women. Mendy, whose contract with Manchester City expired on Saturday, is accused of attacking the woman, aged 24 at the time, at his mansion in Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, in October 2020. Accoring to reports in the   and  , Mendy allegedly raped a young woman then told her "it's fine, I've had sex with 10,000 women". However, Mendy, a World Cup winner with France in 2018, has denied both claims. During his last trial which took place in January earlier this year, the jurors had failed to reach a conclusion on the two charges involving two different women. After the end of his trial in January, the judge at the Chester Crown Court had told the jury of six women and six men that Mendy was found not guilty of the offences alleged by other women. However, the judge had immediately set a new trial date of Monday, June 26, for the two counts on which the jury did not return a verdict. Mendy, who is now a free agent, joined Manchester City from French club Monaco in 2017. He has played 75 times for City, but his playing time was limited by injuries and a loss of form. He has not played since August 15 2021 -- days before he was hit with an initial charge of four counts of rape and one count of sexual assault. The last of his 10 caps for France came in November 2019, after the defender won the World Cup in 2018. (With AFP Inputs)


India Football Coach Igor Stimac Suspended For 2 Games, Fined USD 500 For Red Card Offence In SAFF Championship Game vs Kuwait

India head coach Igor Stimac was on Friday handed a two-match ban for his red-card offence after he argued with the match officials during the home side's 1-1 draw against Kuwait in their last group match of the SAFF Championships

India head coach Igor Stimac was on Friday handed a two-match ban for his red-card offence after he argued with the match officials during the home side's 1-1 draw against Kuwait in their last group match of the SAFF Championships football in Bengaluru. Stimac was also fined USD 500 as the SAFF Disciplinary Committee deemed it a fit case for suspending him for more than one match. He was also handed a red card against Pakistan in India's campaign opener on June 21 but in that case the matter was not referred to the SAFF Disciplinary Committee as the offence was deemed "less serious" and he had to sit out of the subsequent match against Nepal on June 24. But in this case relating to the red card in the Kuwait game on June 27, the matter reached the SAFF Disciplinary Committee which imposed a more severe punishment on the experienced Croatian coach and 1998 Wold Cup bronze medallist. "He (Stimac) has been handed two-match ban and also fined USD 500 (Rs 41,000)," SAFF General Secretary General Anwarul Haq told PTI on Friday. "Unlike the first instance (against Pakistan), the matter reached the SAFF Disciplinary Committee as it was a graver offence. He (Stimac) also used abusive language against the math officials while he was going off the field (after being shown red card)." In the tense match against Kuwait, Stimac engaged in an animated argument with the match officials and was eventually flashed a red card in the 81st minute. In any case, Stimac was to sit out of India's semifinal match against Lebanon on Saturday as one match ban was automatic but now he will not be in the dug out if the home team reaches the final. Assistant coach Mahesh Gawli will have to take his place.


Kylian Mbappe And Les Bleus Call For End To Violence In France

France captain Kylian Mbappe and Les Bleus urged an end to violence and called for "dialogue and reconstruction" on Friday as France was hit by a fourth night of protests after the fatal police shooting of a teenager

France captain   and Les Bleus urged an end to violence and called for "dialogue and reconstruction" on Friday as France was hit by a fourth night of protests after the fatal police shooting of a teenager. "The time of violence must give way to that of mourning, dialogue and reconstruction," the team said in a statement posted on social media by the Paris Saint-Germain superstar. Les Bleus said they were "shocked by the brutal death of young Nahel" but asked that violence give way to "other peaceful and constructive ways of expressing oneself". Clashes with police have shaken many cities and neighbourhoods across France since the death of 17-year-old Nahel, who was shot dead on Tuesday by a police officer during a traffic stop in a Paris suburb. "Since this tragic event, we have witnessed the expression of popular anger, the substance of which we understand, but the form of which we cannot endorse," the French football team said in the message shared on their personal social media accounts. The players said they share "these feelings of pain and sadness" but "it is your property that you are destroying, your neighborhoods, your cities, your places of fulfilment". "In this context of extreme tension, we cannot remain silent and our civic conscience encourages us to call for appeasement, awareness and accountability," they said. "There are other peaceful and constructive ways of expressing ourselves. This is where our energies and our thoughts must be focused". In a separate message sent to followers of the France team, coach Didier Deschamps "welcomed" the initiative of the players. "My staff and I are associated with it," he said. "We also have a thought for Nahel's family. However, without wanting to give lessons to anyone, I have the deep conviction that violence has never solved anything. I hope with all my heart that the situation will improve," he said.


France Forward Marcus Thuram Signs For Inter Milan

Son of 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, the 25-year-old signed a five-year deal with last season's Champions League finalists worth a reported 6.5 million euros ($7.1 million) a season

French international striker Marcus Thuram signed for Inter Milan on a free transfer on Saturday, the Serie A club announced. Son of 1998 World Cup winner Lilian Thuram, the 25-year-old signed a five-year deal with last season's Champions League finalists worth a reported 6.5 million euros ($7.1 million) a season. Inter secured his services on the back of his most successful season for Bundesliga side Borussia Moenchengladbach in which he scored 13 goals -- he became a free agent at the end of the campaign. "Marcus Thuram signs for Inter," read a statement on the club's website. "The forward, who was born in 1997, joins the Nerazzurri following four seasons with Borussia Moenchengladbach." Thuram will play up front alongside   after picking the country of his birth rather than Paris Saint-Germain, replacing veteran   who signed for Turkish giants Fenerbahce last week. He was born in Parma where his father played for five seasons, winning the UEFA Cup and Italian Cup in 1999 as part of a star-studded outfit which also featured Italian icons   and   Cannavaro. Buffon and Cannavaro got the better of Thuram senior at the 2006 World Cup, beating France in the final on penalties. Thuram senior had wanted his son to take up either fencing or judo but he defied his father. Thuram junior also suffered World Cup heartache at the hands of Martinez and Argentina in last December's thrilling World Cup final. France lost on penalties following a thrilling 3-3 draw in which they were 2-0 behind at half-time, with 10-times capped Thuram setting up the equaliser which took the game to extra-time. Thuram may yet have to battle with   for a place in Inter's starting line-up, as the Belgium striker is in discussions to stay in Milan despite his loan from Chelsea ending this week.


Kuwait Beat Bangladesh 1-0 To Enter SAFF Championship Final

Kuwait had to stretch their last sinew before eking out a nervy 1-0 win over Bangladesh to enter the SAFF Championship final in Bengaluru on Saturday

Kuwait had to stretch their last sinew before eking out a nervy 1-0 win over Bangladesh to enter the SAFF Championship final in Bengaluru on Saturday. Abdullah Al Bloushi scored the winner for Kuwait in the dying minutes of the first half of extra time. They will face either India or Lebanon in the summit clash on July 4. Before the goal, the match saw both the sides frittering away chances with abandon. It started in the second minute of the first half itself when Bangladesh's Shekh Morsalin only had Kuwait goalkeeper Anisur Rahman to beat but shot the ball straight into the latter's hands. Kuwait were not far behind either. Mobarak Al Faneeni made a header into an open goal but there was no real power in it as a Bangladesh defender cleared the ball near the line. As the match progressed, the tussle for superiority intensified without a clear winner emerging. Even amid that clash of equals, Bangladesh's veteran striker Rakib Hossain shone brightly with his quick invasions of the rival box. Rakib was very close to putting Bangladesh ahead as well. He had made blazing shots twice in the beginning of the second half and in the 61st minute. But Kuwait custodian Abdul Rahman and the crossbar denied him on both the occasions. Just as the match seemed to be heading towards a shootout, Ahmad Al Dhefeery freed Al Bloushi with a clever pass. Al Bloushi did not fail to find the net this time, breaking Bangladesh hearts. Bangladesh tried gamely in the second half that saw some heated moments involving players and match officials. But Kuwait managed to hang on. PTI UNG ATK ATK

Former Barcelona Boss Gerardo Martino Named Inter Miami Head Coach

Gerardo Martino will take over the team, from interim Javier Morales, once his work documentation has been completed.

Inter Miami have appointed former Barcelona and Argentina coach Gerardo Martino to take charge of the Major League Soccer team, setting up a reunion with compatriot  . Martino, widely known as "Tata," coached Messi with both the Spanish club and his country's national team. He was most recently in charge of Mexico and previously worked in MLS with Atlanta United, winning the title in 2018. Martino's arrival was widely expected after Miami, rock bottom of the Eastern Conference, fired their English coach Phil Neville. The 60-year-old will take over the team, from interim Javier Morales, once his work documentation has been completed. "We are very happy to be able to welcome Tata to Inter Miami. We feel he is a coach who matches our ambitions as a club and we're optimistic about what we can accomplish together," said Inter Miami Managing Owner Jorge Mas. "Tata has coached at the highest levels and we believe that experience will be hugely beneficial to us as we aim to compete for titles here," he added. Messi said earlier this month that he was joining Miami, co-owned by  , having opted to leave Paris Saint-Germain at the end of his contract. The 60-year-old Martino played for and coached Argentine club Newell's Old Boys, where Messi played as a schoolboy. "Tata is a highly respected figure in our sport whose track record speaks for itself," said Beckham. "We are confident that his achievements in the game and experience as a head coach will inspire our team and excite our fans and look forward to seeing the impact he will have on and off the field". The South Florida club also expect to complete the signing of another of Martino's former charges at Barcelona, Spanish midfielder   and Mas has indicated Miami could bring in as many as five players during the summer transfer window. Martino has been out of work since his contract with Mexico ended after a disappointing World Cup campaign where El Tri failed to get out of the group stage. "I'm very excited to join a big club like Inter Miami and I know together we can accomplish many great things," said Martino. "The club has the necessary infrastructure to be a major competitor in the region and I believe that with everyone's hard work and commitment we can get there," he said. Martino made his mark as a coach in Paraguay, leading the national side to the runners-up spot in the 2011 Copa America. After impressing at Newell's he had a season in charge of Barca in 2013-14 before taking over the Argentine national side for two years and then joined Atlanta in 2016. Martino will also be re-united with Venezuelan striker Josef Martinez whose 31 goals in 2018 were crucial to Atlanta's MLS Cup triumph.


Arsenal Sign Kai Havertz From Chelsea On 'Long-Term Contract'

Neither club disclosed a fee but British media said Arsenal were paying Chelsea 65 million pounds or 75 million euros.

Arsenal on Wednesday signed German attacking midfielder   from Chelsea on a "long-term contract". Neither club disclosed a fee but British media said Arsenal were paying Chelsea 65 million pounds or 75 million euros.  He is Arsenal's first signing of the summer but the British press reported the club had agreed a 105 million-pound fee for West Ham's England midfielder  . Havertz joined Chelsea in 2020 from Bayer Leverkusen. He made 139 appearances in three seasons, scoring 32 times, including the only goal in the 2021 UEFA Champions League final victory over Manchester City. Arsenal were runners up in the Premier League last season while Chelsea, rebuilding their squad, were 12th. "The mentality in the Arsenal squad is very high and you can feel that. That was one of the reasons why it has been so hard to play against Arsenal recently," Havertz told the Arsenal web site. "The aim is to win trophies and I'm going to give everything to do that." He posted a farewell message to Chelsea on social media. He said he was writing "with a heavy heart...saying goodbye to the club that has become my second home, and to the incredible fans who have supported me throughout this amazing journey." Arsenal boss   said: "Kai is a player of top quality. He has great versatility and is an intelligent player. He will bring a huge amount of extra strength to our midfield and variety to our play."


SAFF Championship: India To Face Lebanon In Semifinal

Lebanon set up a semifinal clash against hosts India with a 1-0 win over Maldives in a Group B match of the SAFF Championship in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

Lebanon set up a semifinal clash against hosts India with a 1-0 win over Maldives in a Group B match of the SAFF Championship in Bengaluru on Wednesday. Skipper   struck the all-important goal with his curling freekick in the 24th minute. Lebanon have topped the group with an all-win record in the four-team group. Lebanon will take on India in the battle for the summit clash on Saturday. The two teams met recently in the final of the Intercontinental Cup in Bhubaneswar, where India emerged the winners. The Maldives, ranked 154 in the FIFA Men's rankings, were hoping to punch above its weight by winning against Lebanon, whom they have never beaten in previously. Having already sealed their last-four berth, Lebanon head coach Aleksandar Ilic rested a few of his regular players including Karim Darwich. Lebanon started the match on a positive note, keeping plenty of possession and trying to stretch the Maldives defence. The deadlock was finally broken when Lebanon was awarded a free kick a few metres outside the penalty box. Maatouk stepped up to curl in a right-footed shot past Maldives custodian Hussain Shareef. Hussain was left wrong-footed after Hassan's shot took a deflection and went in. The Maldives defence were struggling to cope with Lebanon's constant surge during this spell. Hassan Maatouk combined well with Mohamad Sadek and Zein Al Abidine Farran to create havoc in the rival area. Moments after the first goal, Lebanon squandered a golden opportunity to extend their lead when Mohamad Sadek missed from a close range. He shot well over the crossbar following Zein Al Abidine Farran's brilliant pass from the right. Farran created another opportunity for Lebanon as he chipped in a cross from the right to find Hassan Maatouk but his header lacked power to beat Hussain Shareef in goal. Maldives, on the other hand, failed to have a shot on target and Lebanon goalkeeper   was never tested. Lebanon tried to extend their lead in the second half and had it not been for Hussain Shareef under the bar, the Maldives would have conceded a few more goals. He saved two brilliant attempts from Ali Al Haj in the second half to keep the Maldives in the game. The Maldives finished their SAFF Championship campaign with only one win in three matches.

Messi And Busquets Not Moving To Miami For a Holiday, Says Martino

Martino, former coach of Messi with Barcelona and Argentina, said he had spoken to the seven-times Ballon d'Or winner and former Spain midfielder Busquets about their impending move to the Major League Soccer club

Newly appointed Inter Miami coach Gerardo Martino says there is no question of   and   moving to South Florida to chill on South Beach. Instead, says the Argentine who was appointed on Wednesday, the pair are coming to Miami to fight for titles. Martino, former coach of Messi with Barcelona and Argentina, said he had spoken to the seven-times Ballon d'Or winner and former Spain midfielder Busquets about their impending move to the Major League Soccer club. "Sometimes in our world you associate United States and Miami with holidays. And it's not that. They are coming to compete," he told a press conference on Thursday. "They are coming from winning world titles, Spanish league titles. They are not going to relax. They will compete because it is in their blood," he said. Martino takes over Miami with the club bottom of the Eastern Conference having lost their last seven games. They are ranked 27th out of the 29 clubs in MLS. The former Mexico and Atlanta United coach said there was still the chance to salvage something from this season, however. "One is to see if we can make the playoffs. Right now that seems like a stretch, but as long as we have the possibility we can't stop trying," he said. "We are in a good place in the US Open Cup, and now there's a new tournament, Leagues Cup, that we will aim for. After that, the goal is to build for 2024," added the coach known as 'Tata'. Sporting Director Chris Henderson said the club would be making more changes to their squad in the coming weeks "Come late August we're going to have a different look. This will give the opportunity for Tata and his staff to work with the players in a new way. "It feels like a new beginning for the club and we're going to do everything we can to rise up the table game by game," he added. Martino won MLS Cup in 2018 with Atlanta United and said he was well aware of what awaited him in the North American league. "I see a league that is always evolving, a league that has a lot of rules, but they are very clear," he said. "It is very level for all the teams, the system of budgets and draft allows all teams at the start to have the same aspirations. "I like the complexity of the cold of one place, rain of another, heat of another. All that makes you as a coach have to think about more than just managing what happens on the field," he said. But Martino believes Messi will transform MLS. "That the world's greatest player decides to play in this league, evidently it will open an even greater scenario of growth," he said.


India Bank On Sunil Chhetri Magic To Overcome Lebanon Challenge In SAFF Championships Semis

India, the defending champions, entered the semis as the second-placed team behind Kuwait from Group A while Lebanon topped Group B in their march to the last-four stage.

India will bank on the striking prowess of their talismanic captain Sunil Chhetri to tame a formidable Lebanon in the SAFF Championship semifinal here on Saturday. India, the defending champions, entered the semis as the second-placed team behind Kuwait from Group A while Lebanon topped Group B in their march to the last-four stage. Chhetri has been India's primary weapon in this tournament, as he has so far netted five goals from three matches to sit on top of the goal-scorers' list. The count of goals includes a hat-trick against Pakistan. The sensational tumbling volley against Kuwait during India's last league match underlined his still burning desire to lead the team's charge. Chhetri will have to be on top of his game for India to hurdle over the Lebanon challenge, and this is not to say that others will have a lesser role. The likes of Sahal Abdul Samad, Mahesh Singh and Udanta Singh will have to up the ante to support their skipper. All of them have had their moments in the tournament but apart from Chhetri only Udanta and Mahesh have been able to find the target. India will be served well if they also can chip in with goals as relying on one player, even if he is as great as Chhetri, against an organised side like Lebanon could prove costly. The home side will also hope that their defence will continue to work like a well-oiled machine as they have conceded only one goal in the last nine matches. All these factors might not have lost on the Indians as Lebanon are a rather familiar opponent. The first meeting between these two sides took place in 1977 and since then they have engaged with each other seven more times. Overall, Lebanon hold a 3-2 edge over India with three matches ending in draws. However, India can take solace from the fact that their two recent outings against Lebanon fetched positive results. India held Lebanon to a goalless draw in the league match of the Intercontinental Cup earlier this month in Odisha, and beat them2-0 in the tournament final. But, then, past records have little meaning in the ultra-competitive world of football and India will have to be at their absolute best to beat their West Asian rivals, whose quick counter-attacks can be a thing of worry. They are entering the semis with an all-win record in the group stage, having warded off Bhutan, Maldives and Bangladesh. On the other hand, India were stretched by Nepal and Kuwait after a relatively easy outing against Pakistan. India will miss the presence of their head coach Igor Stimac on the touchline after the Croatian was slapped with his second red card of the tournament during the match against Kuwait. But then this India side has shown the penchant to rise over the rough sea, and the match against Lebanon will be another occasion for an encore. Saturday's matches: Kuwait vs Bangladesh, 3.30 PM, India vs Lebanon, 7.30 PM.


PSG Coach Christophe Galtier Arrested In Discrimination Probe

Christophe Galtier is set to be fired by the Qatari owners of PSG after a largely underwhelming season in which PSG suffered 10 defeats in 2023, exiting the Champions League, the team's main objective, in the last 16.

Paris Saint Germain coach Christophe Galtier was held for questioning along with his son as part of a probe into alleged discrimination, the Nice prosecutor told AFP on Friday. The move follows an investigation launched in April, following claims he made racist and Islamophobic remarks about players when he coached Nice in the 2021/22 season. The prosecutor said they would provide more information on the arrests of Galtier and his son John Valovic-Galtier -- a player's agent -- via a statement later on Friday. Galtier is set to be fired by the Qatari owners of PSG after a largely underwhelming season in which PSG suffered 10 defeats in 2023, exiting the Champions League, the team's main objective, in the last 16. The allegations first surfaced in the French media in April. The reports -- which AFP was unable to verify -- alleged that ex-Nice sporting director Julien Fournier had written an email at the end of the 2021/22 season in which he claimed Galtier had made discriminatory remarks at several members of the Nice squad. "He (Galtier) told me that I should take account of the reality of the city and that in effect we should not have as many blacks and Muslims in the team," claimed Fournier, whose relationship with Galtier was a fraught one. "He told me he wanted to profoundly change the team's make-up and limit the maximum number of Muslims." Galtier said he was "deeply shocked by the claims" and denied the allegations. He launched a defamation suit of his own against the journalist who published the claims and Fournier. Fournier indicated to AFP on May 22 he had been questioned as part of the judicial enquiry without giving any further details. Several players and directors, including the club president  -Pierre Rivere, and former coach   were also questioned by investigators. The message was reportedly sent by Fournier -- whose relationship with Galtier was tense -- to Dave Brailsford, the former head of British Cycling and Team Sky now the Director of Sport at Ineos, the owners of Nice. Galtier and Fournier both left Nice last year after working together at the club for one season, with the former being appointed by PSG.

Argentina legend   has brought an end to his European adventure and is all set to play in the United States of America for Inter Miami. Messi reportedly had a lucrative offer on the table from Saudi Arabia but he decided to switch to the Major League Soccer instead.

"It May Come On A Day When...": India Football Great Sunil Chhetri Opens Up On "Last Game For The Country"

Sunil Chhetri is 38 but still continues to be the spearhead of Indian attack, evidenced by the five goals he netted in the ongoing SAFF Championship from three matches

India skipper and mercurial striker   on Friday played down the talks about his retirement saying he has not put any timeline for himself to bid adieu to the game. Chhetri is 38 but still continues to be the spearhead of Indian attack, evidenced by the five goals he netted in the ongoing SAFF Championship from three matches. "I don't know when my last game for the country is going to be. It derives from the fact that I have never had long-term targets, I think about next match, next 10 days. It (retirement) may come at a day when probably I don't want to, as there are a lot of things, and I will be done. Till that time, I never think about it," Chhetri said on the eve of India's semifinal against Lebanon. Chhetri, the second highest goal-scorer from Asia with 91 goals, said he has set some parameters for himself to determine about hanging his boots. "Generally, there are some parameters that I think about... whether I am contributing to the team or not, whether I am able to score goal or not, training as hard as I want or not. These are some of the markers that will tell me whether I am good for this team or not. The day I see that it is not there, I am done, I am gone because there is not any other motivation for me to play. "But sadly, I can't tell whether it (retirement) is in one year or six months. Fortunately or unfortunately my family is also guessing this, and whenever they mention this, jokingly, I tell my stats to them. The day I am finished with my petrol or diesel or electric or whatever I am done," said Chhetri. Chhetri said Lebanon are a tough side and taking them for granted might backfire. He did not read too much into India's 2-0 victory over Lebanon in the recent Intercontinental Cup final. "Lebanon is a tough side. We have already played them twice. I'm pretty sure they have the same feeling about us and trying to stay calm. We did our best to recuperate after so many games in such short time," said Chhetri. India's assistant coach Mahesh Gawli said the team is motivated and ready for the big test against Lebanon. "Lebanon is a good side and we are prepared for the fight. The boys are motivated, the boys are committed, focused and will continue to the show the same metal which we showed in the previous matches," said Gawli.


Tottenham Hotspur Buy James Maddison From Relegated Leicester

Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday completed the signing of creative midfielder James Maddison from relegated Leicester in a deal worth 40 million pounds

Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday completed the signing of creative midfielder   from relegated Leicester in a deal worth 40 million pounds (46.3m euros) plus add-ons. The 26-year-old England international signed a five-year deal. Maddison began his career with Coventry City before joining Norwich City in January, 2016. He moved to Leicester in 2018 and in five seasons made 203 appearances, scored 55 goals and helped win the FA Cup. He scored 10 goals last season as Leicester were relegated from the Premier League. He has three England caps. Maddison's creativity will boost a Spurs squad that has lacked a player in his mould since   left in 2020. He is the club's third signing of the summer. Winger Dejan Kulusevski's loan switch from Juventus was made permanent and goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario joined from another Italian club, Empoli. Speculation continues to swirl around Tottenham's star striker   who is entering the last year of his contract. Bayern Munich have agreed personal terms with the England captain, German daily Bild reported Wednesday, but an initial 70-million-euro bid was rejected by Tottenham. Kane's camp is believed to have approved the move, but Bayern need an agreement on a fee with Tottenham to seal the transfer. Bayern submitted an offer of 70 million euros plus add-ons for Kane, according to Bild, while Spurs are demanding at least 100 million euros to part with their talismanic striker.
