PSG's plethora of problems: From Lionel Messi's controversial contract extension to convincing Kylian Mbappe to stay

The reigning Ligue 1 champions are still on course for an 11th title but all is not well at the Parc des Princes...

Last Saturday, the PSG ultras issued a letter to club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi. They asked to meet with him,   with the club's "flashy" signings and dubbed PSG's project "a sports policy without real direction". There is, perhaps, good reason for their anger. PSG have stagnated as a club this year. They lost in the   and were knocked out of the Coup de France by arch-rivals Marseille. And although they are partaking in the customary walking of Ligue 1, their campaign hasn't been as smooth as it should be. As the international break ends, everything should be rather simple in Paris. Indeed, for all of this year's madness, the club simply has to see out the season without concern of extra competitions or further hurdles to negotiate.  But look beyond that, and PSG are in a state of chaos. The project is lacking in direction,  , Kylian Mbappe has no real reason to stay, and  .  In other words: the ultras have a point.  takes a look at the plethora of problems facing PSG as the season winds to a close... 


Real Madrid's next boss: Mauricio Pochettino, Raul and the leading candidates to replace under-pressure coach Carlo Ancelotti

Carlo Ancelotti could leave the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season and there are several possible replacements...

Carlo Ancelotti hasn't done much wrong as Real Madrid coach. Since arriving for the second time 18 months ago, he has won La Liga and the Champions League – and could win the latter again this season.  He has revived an ageing squad, helped   become a Ballon d'Or winner, and developed   into a world-class winger.  But now, his job is being called into question. Barcelona are running away with La Liga and with   it appears his days in Spain could be numbered.  That leaves Madrid potentially looking for a new manager this summer, and they can likely get whoever they want.  Such is the pull of the club, and the relentlessness of President Florentino Perez, that Los Blancos are very hard to turn down. Still, this could be a particularly appointment to make.  In Ancelotti, Madrid had the right kind of character for the job. The famously sound man-manager has brought the team immense success on confidence alone, allowing a world-class squad to play to their own beat.  But Madrid have become predictable, and  . The  Indeed, the experienced squad that grinded their way to a European-domestic double is on their way out, while a wave of youth talent could still do with moulding and guidance.

Brendan Rodgers SACKED! Leicester lose patience with manager after Crystal Palace defeat heightens relegation fears

Leicester have sacked Brendan Rodgers, with the former Celtic manager seeing his four year reign at the club come to an end.

Leicester have endured a difficult season, losing 17 of their 28 fixtures so far.

Leicester were also on the periphery of a European final last year, but lost to Roma in the Europa Conference League semi-final.

Why Arsenal striker Gabriel Jesus is a ‘bit disappointed’ after returning from injury & getting back among the goals

Gabriel Jesus is back among the goals at Arsenal and the ambitious Brazilian is a “bit disappointed” not to be seeing more game time for the Gunners.

Mikel Arteta has made a point of easing the 25-year-old striker back into his plans following a three-month spell on the sidelines with  . Jesus was handed his first Premier League start since returning to fitness in a 4-1 victory over Leeds – with his   as he bagged a brace – and the former Manchester City star says he is ready to play more of a prominent role for the Gunners over the coming weeks. Jesus has told   of his comeback and being replaced just after the hour mark against Leeds: “I love challenges. Obviously with an injury and when there’s surgery involved, it’s not easy but if God gives me this challenge, it’s because I can survive and come back stronger. I remember day one of rehab, working hard and thinking about the way to come back. If I don’t work hard, I’ll come back soft. Obviously, every player wants to play the full 90 minutes, I think I’m ready to play more minutes. However, when the ref said to me I was going off, I was a little bit disappointed because I want to play, but of course I respect the manager and the other players as well. So, it was 60 minutes, but I enjoyed it a lot.” Jesus is now up to seven goals for Arsenal, following his move to Emirates Stadium in the summer of 2022, and will be hoping to reach at least double figures before the end of the season. Jesus has helped the Gunners to open up an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League table, with there just nine games left for them to navigate in   since the fabled ‘Invincibles’ of 2003-04.


Craig Bellamy: Former Liverpool & Man City star owes over £1m in tax and has been declared bankrupt

Former Liverpool and Manchester City forward Craig Bellamy has been declared bankruptcy as he owes over £1 million in tax.

The 43-year-old, who currently works as an assistant manager at Burnley, has revealed that due to some poor advice he took earlier in his career, his financial situation is in a mess and he had to declare bankruptcy after losing everything he owned. He also clarified that his bankruptcy was not due to any vices, such as gambling or addiction, and advised young footballers to take heed of his situation. Speaking to the  , Bellamy said: "Everything I have had has been taken from me. If you get the wrong people advising you it all haemorrhages, it all dwindles. It has got to the point where bankruptcy is a relief. It means I can just live again. I know some people will probably think I have squandered all my money on drinking or gambling or drugs. I haven't. I can go quiet where you won't hear from me but I won't be down the pub. I have never touched drugs since I was a young kid. I don't gamble - I have never gambled. It doesn't make any sense to me. But I have gambled on people, unfortunately. "I was brought up in a generation of footballers where everything was done for you. Every bill. Wherever I was, the club did everything for me. I think that's wrong. It makes you too vulnerable. It's good for players to have their own responsibilities because one day the club will not be there. You will finish your career and you will still be a young man, and when you finish who's going to pay your stuff then? You are going to have to learn to survive. You are going to have to live in the real world." Bellamy represented Liverpool for two seasons and also played for Manchester City between 2009 and 2012. He was also the skipper of the Wales national side and represented them from 1998 to 2013, appearing in 78 international matches. The Burnley assistant manager currently does not own a house or a car and does not have any mortgages. He 


Arsenal loanee Nuno Tavares sent away from Marseille training over lack of effort

Despite being kicked out of training, the full-back started in Marseille's 1-1 draw against Montpellier on Friday. He will likely be involved again as the French side take on Lorient on April 9.

Where does benched Joao Cancelo fit into Thomas Tuchel’s plans? Bayern Munich loan star gets game time assurance

Joao Cancelo began the Thomas Tuchel era at Bayern Munich on the bench, but he has been offered assurances over game time under a new coach.

The versatile Portugal international   during the January transfer window. That deal includes a purchase option, but Cancelo quickly   while working under Julian Nagelsmann. A   has now been made by Bayern, but the 28-year-old saw Benjamin Pavard and Alphonso Davies picked ahead of him in right and left-back berths for a convincing 4-2 victory over fellow Bundesliga title hopefuls Borussia Dortmund. Cancelo did replace Davies for the final 11 minutes of that contest, with Bayern director Hasan Salihamidzic telling   afterwards when asked about where a notable winter addition figures in the plans of a newly-appointed boss: “The coach made that decision today but Joao is a top player that we need. For sure Cancelo will get his games.” Cancelo has started four Bundesliga games for Bayern, but he has been unable to nail down one specific role and continues to see questions asked of whether he will be allowed to return to England once a short-term loan agreement comes to a close at the end of the 2022-23 campaign. Cancelo is still tied to a contract at City through to 2027, having previously helped them to two Premier League titles, but it remains to be seen where his long-term future will lie as he attempts to convince ex-Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain boss Tuchel of his worth.


Will Mohamed Salah & Virgil van Dijk consider transfers without Champions League football at Liverpool? Robbie Fowler airs top-four failure fear

Failure to qualify for the Champions League could see Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk consider moves away from Liverpool, says Robbie Fowler.

The Reds have endured a frustrating 2022-23 campaign, with struggles for consistency set to see them  . There is also a very real threat that the Merseyside giants could find themselves  , with Fowler conceding that experienced stars may be left with little choice but to mull over their options if elite European competition proves to be out of reach for Jurgen Klopp’s side. Legendary former Reds striker Fowler has told  : “I don’t think I’m being dramatic if I say that should Liverpool fail to qualify for the Champions League next season, then it will damage the club, both in terms of finances, and in terms of the players who may leave. I wouldn’t be entirely surprised if the likes of Salah and van Dijk thought they need to be playing in the elite European competition at their age, and can’t waste a single season out of it. I’m not saying they’d want to go, but it will be a question they may ask themselves. “But even more worrying, is the fact that losing out on Champions League money could seriously damage their ability to compete in the summer transfer market. Can you say hand on heart that, say, Jude Bellingham and Mason Mount would want to miss out on the Champions League. And with the likes of City and Real Madrid also in for those players, it ties Liverpool’s gloves behind their back, in what is already a pretty unfair financial fight.” Salah is tied to a contract at Anfield through to 2025, with Dutch defender Van Dijk working on terms intended to keep him in his current surroundings until the same summer as his Egyptian team-mate.  of late, although exit rumours have been rubbished, while Van Dijk is considered to have   in what has been a testing campaign for all concerned on the red half of Merseyside.


Almost as good as Gabriel Slonina! Chicago Fire's Chris Brady makes history with clean sheet against D.C. United

On Saturday evening, Chris Brady became the second youngest player to keep a clean sheet in Major League Soccer just behind Gabriel Slonina.

 During their match against DC United, Chicago Fire managed to record a clean sheet which ensured their keeper, Chris Brady, became the second youngest stopper to pick up a shut-out in MLS history, aged 19 years and 29 days. The first remains Gabriel Slonina, who also achieved the feat with Chicago Fire.  Brady will be hoping that he can continue to follow in Slonina's footsteps after having impressed against DC United. Slonina currently plays with Chelsea after completing a permanent transfer to the Premier League side in August 2022. With his shutout tonight, the  ’s Chris Brady (19 years, 29 days) became the second-youngest goalkeeper in   history to produce a clean sheet, behind only Gabriel Slonina (17 years, 137 days).

Real Madrid player ratings: Karim Benzema bags three, Vinicius Jr sets up two as Real Madrid smash SIX past Real Valladolid ahead of Copa Clasico

A rampant Real Madrid side put six past Valladolid in a promising warm-up for their Copa del Rey contest with Barcelona midweek

Three goals in seven first-half minutes from Karim Benzema broke open a tight contest as Real Madrid cruised to a 6-0 victory over Valladolid.  Rodrygo opened the scoring after a dour start. Marco Asensio created it, dribbling through the centre of the pitch and slipping the Brazilian through — who drove his finish into the far corner.  Benzema made it two five minutes later, nodding Vinicius Jr's angled cross home from short range. He  , with a fine curler and acrobatic flick, rounding out a devastating first-half showing. Asensio and Lucas Vazquez added two more in the second, turning a rout into a thrashing.

But with the two sides due to meet in a Copa del Rey semi-final on Wednesday, it might just have been the perfect warm-up.  rates Real Madrid's players from Santiago Bernabeu...


Mexico open door for sensational Chicharito return! New El Tri manager says banished Javier Hernandez could come back if fit

Javier "Chicharito" Hernandez hasn't played for Mexico since 2019 but could be welcomed back by Diego Cocca this year.

Chicharito's   meant he was never in serious contention for the 2022 World Cup, but the 34-year-old could make a dramatic return to his national team this month when El Tri face the United States in a friendly. Cocca suggested fitness is the obstacle that would keep him out of action - not relationships in the federation. "I have to evaluate the player not only by his characteristics, but also by the moment he is going through," Cocca told reporters on Tuesday. "Today I can have a list and I have to wait until the weekend to see how the players finish, logically I have communication with many of them and that is what I want, I want to listen to him and know how he is, if he is injured, I do it with him and with everyone and we will see what is the best decision." Chicharito, still playing for the LA Galaxy, hasn't suited up yet for his club this term due to hamstring problem. But he's participated in training recently and may be ready for game action soon. In addition to his potential Mexico responsibilities, the former Manchester United star must make an impact with the Galaxy, who have gone five games without a win to start the 2023 season.

Frank Lampard as permanent Chelsea manager? Guus Hiddink advises Blues to keep caretaker coach

Former Chelsea manager Guus Hiddink believes the Blues should be considering turning Frank Lampard’s caretaker role into a permanent agreement.

The Premier League giants have   at Stamford Bridge on an interim basis after taking the decision to part company with Graham Potter. Lampard has answered an SOS call and agreed to see things through to the end of the 2022-23 campaign. He is back in west London a little over two years after seeing his own managerial stint brought to a close, but Hiddink feels he could be the best man to take the club forward – with the likes of Julian Nagelsmann and Luis Enrique boasting no  . Hiddink, who has taken in two spells at Chelsea caretaker – leading them to FA Cup glory in 2009 – has told   of Lampard’s return to the Bridge: “Honestly, I would like him to be considered not just as an interim coach. But also to be given the confidence to continue with the project next season. He knows the club like nobody else and it’s important to give continuity to things. Like anyone, Lampard is going to need time. Chelsea have invested a lot of money but now need to adapt to an idea. I’m very fond of him, I hope he will get Chelsea out of this predicament and get them back to where they deserve to be.” Lampard took in 84 games in charge of Chelsea between the summer of 2019 and January 2021, winning 44 of those fixtures before agreeing to walk away as the reins were passed to Thomas Tuchel – who would go on to deliver a Champions League triumph for the Blues after less than six months in charge.

Celtic’s Irish connection: Why Scottish club are associated with Ireland

The Glasgow club have a rich history that has a distinct Irish flavour to it - GOAL takes a look at the connection

 hold the distinction of being the first British club to win the European Cup and they are among Britain's best supported teams. However, while they are undoubtedly Scottish and British, the Glasgow outfit have a strong connection to Ireland and a unique affinity with Irish supporters. Where did it come from and how has their identity developed?   takes a look at Celtic's enduring association with Ireland. An Irish identity has been strongly imbued in the fabric of Celtic ever since the club's foundation in 1887. The club was established by an Irishman,  , whose goal was to help improve the conditions in which the Irish immigrant population in Glasgow lived. Walfrid, who was born Andrew Kerins in Ballymote Co. Sligo, chose the name Celtic  . A Celtic cross and later a four-leaf clover (note, not a shamrock) - symbols with a distinctly Irish flavour - have featured on the club's badge, while their colours, green and white, are also synonymous with Ireland. As well as being founded by an Irishman and leaving little doubt about what they represent in their kit iconography,  . While he played internationally for Scotland, Maley, who won 16 league titles and 14 Scottish Cups as Celtic boss, was born in Newry, County Down, a town in the north of Ireland. In 1892, in order to further reinforce the Irishness of Celtic,   at the newly constructed Celtic Park was one that had been  . It was planted along with a smattering of shamrocks by Irish republican leader Michael Davitt. The symbolism of this moment in the club's history was later invoked following the redevelopment of the stadium in 1995 when a piece of turf sourced from The Rosses area of Donegal was also laid. Irish players and managers have also helped to maintain the strong links between the club and Ireland. Martin O'Neill, Brendan Rodgers, Neil Lennon, Liam Brady and Sean Fallon all managed the team, while players such as Mick McCarthy, Paddy McCourt, Liam Miller, Robbie Keane and Roy Keane are held in high regard by fans for their efforts in a Celtic shirt. Celtic draw upon a deep well of support throughout the island of Ireland. The   (AICSC) lists   on its directory and there are plenty of unofficial groupings dotted throughout the island too. When Celtic played League of Ireland side Shamrock Rovers in a pre-season friendly in 2017 it was described as a "symbolic" game by then manager Brendan Rodgers. "Lots of our supporters come from Ireland and all around the world," Rodgers told the official club website ahead of the game in Dublin. "I think during pre-season it's always nice to take our players to the supporters and obviously going to Ireland is very symbolic for everyone involved at Celtic." Brian McGuirk, author of  , explained that Celtic is "more than a football club" for Irish people. "Celtic is a club that we Irish and our diaspora can proudly call our own," McGuirk said. "Celtic is our legacy, left to us by the courage and vision of Irish men like Brother Walfrid, John Glass and Pat Welsh. "Many of the ‘great men’ involved in Celtic’s formation were immigrants into Glasgow from their native Ireland, a country crippled by famine and political unrest. “We didn’t just happen to support Celtic; Celtic is a part of us. Celtic for us is so much more than a football club. Celtic is an institution, an identity and a celebration of being Irish or being of Ireland." The matter of supporting Celtic in Northern Ireland is somewhat complicated by the bloody socio-political conflict that gripped the region during the late 20th century, with the Old Firm derby providing convenient totemic institutions to which individuals could tether. Support for Celtic for many fans in Northern Ireland is an expression of their Irishness. Correspondingly, among some in the British community in Northern Ireland, support for Celtic's arch rivals Rangers has become an expression of their Britishness. Sympathy for the cause of Irish republicanism has long featured in the stands of Celtic Park - though not endorsed by the club - with fans occasionally getting into trouble for displaying contentious political banners. For example, a banner juxtaposing William Wallace with IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands, which appeared during a Champions League game against AC Milan in 2013,   from UEFA. The club was   for a similar banner showing a masked paramilitary figure, which was unveiled in a Champions League qualifier against Linfield. Interestingly, while they are known the world over as Scotland's Irish club, Celtic are not the only club from the country with an intrinsic Irish dimension. Indeed, Edinburgh outfit  , whose name is derived from the Latin name for Ireland (Hibernia), were established in 1875 - 12 years before Celtic - by Irish immigrants and, indeed, served as a source of inspiration for the Parkhead team. Like Celtic, Hibernian have Irish symbols in their badge (a harp) and play in green and white. Elsewhere, in the Scottish city Dundee, Irish immigrants sought to emulate Hibernian in 1909 by setting up a team called Dundee Hibernian - now known as  . However, the club's historic Irish connections are nowhere near as emphasised as Celtic's. It's not just football where Irishness is a core component of a team's identity. NBA team  , founded in 1946, embraced the profound sense of Irishness within the city of Boston in their name, logo (Lucky the Leprechaun), and colourway. Intercollegiate American Football team   in Indiana are known as the  . Like other teams to embrace the Irish identity they have a leprechaun mascot (previously Irish terrier dogs) and play in variations of blue, gold and green. It is unclear where the Irish connection stems from, but   from the influence of Irish politician Eamon De Valera to the fact that many players were from Irish families.

USWNT phenom Alyssa Thompson 'will make a case' for World Cup spot but coach Vlatko Andonovski offers warning

USWNT head coach Vlatko Andonovski said 18-year-old Alyssa Thompson is still in contention for the Women's World Cup but also expressed concern.

Thompson is not in   despite scoring five minutes into her first NWSL game with Angel City on March 9 and continuing to drum up excitement as  . Andonovski explained his decision-making on Thompson during a conversation with reporters on Tuesday, claiming she was still in the running for a World Cup spot this summer but warning that he didn't want to tarnish her enjoyment of soccer. “If there’s a coach that believes in Alyssa Thompson, it would probably be me,” Andonovski said. “Not long ago when she was 17 years old, her first cap was against one of the best teams in the world in front of 80,000 people, and that was a decision that I made. So that speaks of how much I value Alyssa and how much I believe in her. “I think that she has a lot of potential and I do believe that she will make a case for a [World Cup] roster spot. Part of the reason why she was in those [fall] camps was that if it happens that she has a good season and earns a roster spot for the World Cup, that it’s not her first camp. She already has experience being in the environment, understands the dynamics in the environment. She has already played in big matches against good opponents, so the transition is not as hard for her.” In a warning about her status, though, the coach added: “I do want to point out one thing about Alyssa. At this point the most important thing is that she enjoys the game, that she enjoys her club environment because we don’t want to put too much pressure on her. She’s a young player, a talented player, a good player and all she needs to do is just to enjoy the game.” Thompson is part of a promising crop of talented young USWNT attackers. Trinity Rodman (20), Sophia Smith (22), Catarina Macario (23) and Mallory Swanson (24) are just a few of the players who will foster a fierce competition for starting spots along the team's front-line. Andonovski's squad will be in action on April 8 against the Republic of Ireland.


Two assists in NINE minutes for Kevin De Bruyne! Man City star on fire for Belgium ahead of huge Liverpool Premier League clash

Kevin De Bruyne was back doing what he does best as his two assists in nine minutes put Belgium 2-0 up against Germany on Tuesday.

 Domenico Tedesco's side set about blowing Germany away on home soil as Hansi Flick's men were left exposed on a number of occasions in the first half in Cologne. Belgium punished them twice, largely thanks to De Bruyne. First, he threaded in Yannick Carrasco in acres of space, who controlled and finished expertly past Marc-Andre ter Stegen within 6 minutes. Carrasco opens the scoring early for  ! ⚽️🇧🇪  Kevin De Bruyne ➡️ Romelu Lukaku 🔥 The Red Devils takes a 2-0 the lead! 🇧🇪   Then, three minutes on, and after just nine minutes of play, Germany were cut open again in a move that started from a Koen Casteels goal kick. A few flicks later and De Bruyne was on the ball, sliding a delicious pass through Flick's defence and Romelu Lukaku was on hand to finish with aplomb, making it four goals in less than 100 minutes for the Red Devils forward this international break. H Pep Guardiola would have enjoyed De Bruyne's performance as Manchester City have a huge Premier League clash with Liverpool this weekend. City currently trail leaders Arsenal by eight points and cannot afford any slip-ups if they are to secure a third successive title.

Who is Belgium's leading all-time top goal scorer? Lukaku, Hazard and the Red Devils' greatest strikers

Belgium's greatest goal scorers features some top modern day stars.

Belgium have had many great players representing them internationally, with their so-called Golden Generation of the 2010s in particular making waves. There's far more to Belgium than their current generation of superstars, though. Sure, we all know of Kevin De Bruyne, Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens, but what about Marc Wilmots, Belgium's greatest goal-scorer at the World Cup? Or Or all-time greats such as Paul Van Himst and Jan Ceulemans?

But who is Belgium's most lethal attacker ever? Let's take a look!


Spain player ratings vs Scotland: Full-backs Dani Carvajal & Pedro Porro FLOP as much-rotated La Roja are humbled by Scotland

Scott McTominay scored twice to lift Scotland past a lifeless Spain side at Hampden Park.

Errors from two full-backs marked a forgettable evening for a much-changed Spain team, as La Roja fell 2-0 to Scotland.  Pedro Porro made the first mistake, easily ceding the ball to an advancing Andy Robertson, who fed McTominay for a 1-0 Scotland lead inside 10 minutes.  La Roja did show some fight for the remainder of the first period, with Joselu rattling the bar and Porro forcing a diving stop out of Angus Gunn.  Then, a second error doomed the Spanish. Dani Carvajal was barged off the ball by a surging Kieran Tierney, whose angled cross deflected into the path of McTominay to hand the home side a 2-0 advantage — an unassailable deficit for Luis de la Fuente's side.   rates Spain's players from Hampden Park...


St. Louis City SC forward Nicholas Gioacchini says dream start to 2023 is something whole team will 'remember for the rest of their lives'

St Louis City SC have set several records so far and they look set on breaking a few more before the season is over.

 St. Louis defeated Real Salt Lake 4-0 away at the Rio Tinto Stadium in their fifth straight victory to start the campaign, a run that has only been matched three times before - and never in an expansion team's first five games. Gioacchini, who scored against Real Salt Lake, has been a major part of the success so far and is cherishing the feelings around the club.  “It's memorable," he told reporters. "It's something that I think every player will remember for the rest of their lives. It hasn't happened yet, five wins from an expansion team. Even five wins in a row in a league for teams that have been here for a while. It's not easy as you can see in past seasons.”    St. Louis City SC host Minnesota United, who have gone unbeaten thus far with two wins and two draws. They will be looking to become only the second team in MLS history (non-shootout) to win their first six games of the season.


Who is the leading all-time top goal scorer for Poland? Lewandowski and The Eagles' greatest strikers

Poland has been consistently producing some top goal scorers, but no one tops Robert Lewandowski

Poland have arguably produced some of the greatest footballers in history. We all know Robert Lewandowski, but what about Grzegorz Lato, Poland's hero at the 1974 World Cup, where they finished third! Or Zbigniew Boniek, who was selected by Pele as one of his 100 best footballers in 2004.

‘Only Lionel Messi is above Bukayo Saka at the moment’ – Arsenal star boy obvious pick as Footballer of the Year, says Tony Adams

Only Lionel Messi sits above Bukayo Saka in the global pecking order, says Tony Adams, with the Arsenal star heading for Player of the Year honours.

The 21-year-old forward has been a revelation for the Gunners this season, posting a   across all competitions. Saka has also contributed 10 assists to the Gunners cause, as they sit top of the Premier League table, while also catching the eye for England at the 2022 World Cup. Legendary former Arsenal captain Adams believes Saka now  , telling  : “If there’s a better player in world football at the moment, someone who both scores and makes goals, the only one I can think of is Lionel Messi. Bukayo is absolutely on fire and the reason Arsenal are top of the table. Erling Haaland might be scoring hundreds of goals for Manchester City and Marcus Rashford is also having a phenomenal season for United. But Bukayo is, hands down, the Footballer of the Year because he was England’s best player at the World Cup and he’s been the best player for the team eight points clear at the top of the Premier League.” Arsenal are currently in the process of  , with his current deal due to expire in 2024, and Adams is eager to see paperwork put in place there. He added: “When Manchester City paid £100 million to sign Jack Grealish 18 months ago, I couldn’t believe that they didn’t even try to buy Bukayo Saka. Even now I’m gobsmacked that Arsenal have been able to hang on to a kid who is already one of the best talents in the world. Hopefully, they will soon get Bukayo tied down to a lengthy new contract so I can stop worrying. Like me, he’s a London-born Arsenal fan who graduated through the academy and has the club in his blood. But even though the Gunners hierarchy are pretty confident he’s never going to leave them, they should never take that loyalty for granted.” Saka has   in recent windows, but a Premier League title triumph in 2022-23 would be a useful bargaining chip for Arsenal as they seek to get a home-grown star to commit to them on a long-term basis.


Wayne Rooney backs Marcus Rashford to BREAK his Man Utd scoring record amid forward's resurgence under Erik ten Hag

Wayne Rooney has backed Marcus Rashford to break his Manchester United scoring record after his scintillating return to form under Erik ten Hag.

Rashford   and became the first Manchester United player since Rooney to score in seven straight Premier League games at Old Trafford after he bagged a brace against Leicester City. Although, Rashford, with 120 goals to his name for United in total,   of 253 goals for United, the current D.C. United manager believes the 25-year-old has all the attributes to set a new mark. “I think we’ve all known about Marcus, even before he was in the first team, coming through the academy. He’s a top player and he fell off a little bit over the last 18 months especially. And again, I think Ten Hag has come in and really simplified it for him,” the former United striker said to  "I’m not a player who sits on records and hopes no one breaks them. I hope he does it and the reasons why [with] him being a Manchester lad coming through the academy. I think it’s a great story and it means he’s been very successful with the club and been there a long time and scored a lot of goals if he does do it. So I hope he does. I think he certainly has the ability and the capabilities to be able to do it. I’m sure, or I hope, sometime in the next few years I’ll be able to pass that mantle onto him." Rashford had a disappointing individual campaign in 2021-22, scoring only five times in all competitions, but Ten Hag has managed to unlock his full potential this term. The United boss   at the start of the campaign, but praised the England international's mentality which has helped him reach a new level since returning from the World Cup break. Rashford   for their first two 2024 European Championship qualifiers after picking up a knock against Fulham, but is on course to return to action when United make a trip to St. James Park to take on Newcastle United on Saturday.


Cristiano Ronaldo 'got what he wanted' with Man Utd exit but will 'always be a club legend', says Wayne Rooney

Wayne Rooney admits Cristiano Ronaldo “got what he wanted” when forcing an exit at Manchester United, but says the Portuguese remains a club legend.

The five-time Ballon d’Or winner   after taking aim at several prominent figures from the club’s present and past in an explosive interview. Rooney concedes that the 38-year-old – who is now in Saudi Arabia with Al-Nassr –   with the all-time great leaving United with no choice but to rip up his contract and move in a different direction. Rooney, who is  , has told   of seeing Ronaldo manufacture a move away from Old Trafford: “I suppose he got what he wanted. For Manchester United, it was important to move on as quick as possible from that and really refocus on the group of players who were there and wanted to be there. And I think that’s where [Erik] ten Hag has done a really good job in refocusing the players and getting them in a position where they are, obviously, comfortably in the top four, and also winning the [Carabao] Cup.” There have been suggestions that Ronaldo has   with his antics during a second spell in England, but Rooney insists that his former team-mate remains an icon in Manchester. He added: “No, I think what he’s done for Manchester United is great. And he’s won Premier League titles, won the Champions League, scored many goals. So I think certainly for the fans and certainly for the players, his former team-mates who played with him from my time especially, we’ll never forget what he did for Manchester United. Because in my eyes, he’ll always be a club legend and it’s a shame the way it ended of course this time round. But I don’t think that takes anything away from his legacy at the club.” Ronaldo registered 118 goals for United during his first stint with the club – winning three Premier League titles and the Champions League – while he found the target on 27 occasions through 54 appearances after returning to Old Trafford from Juventus in 2021.

USMNT Power Rankings: Who will make the 2026 World Cup squad?

With qualification already secure for the next global tournament, GOAL breaks down who is most likely to feature for the co-hosts

The U.S. men's national team's road to the 2026 World Cup effectively began the moment the final whistle blew at Khalifa International Stadium following   Players were asked about it in the moments after: What that road would look like, who would be a part of it, who would lead the charge. Much will change on that road, and predicting World Cup squads years in advance is almost impossible. Three years before the 2022 World Cup, for example, USMNT fans knew nothing of Yunus Musah. Matt Turner was barely a starter in 2019. Brenden Aaronson didn't even make his MLS debut until midway through that year. But here we are predicting that road. Given the youth of the 2022 World Cup team, it's safe to say we know some players who will be involved. Much of the team's young core isn't going anywhere, which is great news for whoever coaches the team this cycle. Some players, too, will likely age out, with veterans such as DeAndre Yedlin, Aaron Long and Sean Johnson unlikely to be involved all the way through the cycle, even if they are there for parts of it. Some World Cup veterans, players like Shaq Moore and Cristian Roldan, will still be in the mix, but face battles to stay involved due to young players coming up behind them.

How many goals has Robert Lewandowski scored for Poland? Barcelona star's full World Cup, Euro, Nations League and international friendly record

The Barcelona striker is the highest goalscorer for Poland by quite a distance

Robert Lewandowski is Poland's greatest goalscorer in history and it seems unlikely he will be losing that record any time soon. The Barcelona striker has consistently been scoring since his debut against San Marino back in 2008. Lewandowski's most clinical performance for the national team came when he scored four goals against Gibraltar in 2014 in Poland's Euro 2016 qualifier.

Fulham's Aleksandar Mitrovic makes bizarre excuse for referee push: 'I was trying to get his attention'

Fulham forward Aleksandar Mitrovic offered an unusual excuse to his push on Chris Kavanagh which saw him sent off and later charged by the FA.

The Serbia international saw red in what was a minute of complete capitulation from Fulham, who were in control over Manchester United in their FA Cup quarter-final earlier this month. Mitrovic shoved Kavanagh after the referee sent off Willian for a clear handball which  . The forward was then duly dismissed alongside manager Marco Silva,    "On a personal level, I regret my actions that led to me being sent off. I allowed my frustration to get the better of me, and how I reacted was wrong," Mitrovic began. "I was trying to get the referee's attention," the statement continued, "but I appreciate that I should not have put my hands on him and I understand why he showed me a red card. I have accepted the three-match ban for my red card, I have spoken to Chris Kavanagh to apologise, and I have volunteered to accept a club fine." Silva - who was also charged for allegedly kicking a bottle in the direction of Kavanagh in the almost unprompted melee - also showed remorse, writing in his statement: "I should have controlled my own emotions better. I regret what happened, and I have spoken to Chris Kavanagh to apologise. He knows that I respect him and the job he has to do. "Unfortunately, we did not see eye-to-eye on the day, but I recognise that he is one of the top referees in this country and I know that when our paths cross again, there will be mutual respect between us. I am sorry that I was not on the pitch to try to lead the team to what could have been an historic FA Cup semi-final at Wembley." For Fulham,  , Silva and, to a lesser extent Willian, cost the club their first ever chance of a major trophy in a quarter-final in which they were dominating, right up to that minute of madness. The players will do their best to put that behind them, though, when they return to Premier League action away to Bournemouth on Saturday.

Sensitive La Liga cracks down on referee criticism! Sergio Canales suspended four matches for questioning Mateu Lahoz's integrity amid Barcelona scandal

Real Betis midfielder Sergio Canales has been hit with a four-game suspension over comments he made against referee Mateu Lahoz six months ago.

Having not been sent off in his decade-long career, Canales was dismissed within 13 seconds in  . It was revealed that the first yellow - according to Lahoz - was for "making observations", while the second was made after Canales responded to the referee's remarks warning him not to talk any further. However, it is the comments after the match which have landed the Betis midfielder in hot water.

'I know what I can do' - Aurelien Tchouameni not worried about becoming Real Madrid transfer flop

Real Madrid midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni has insisted that he can get back to his best and does not fear failure at the Santiago Bernabeu.

 The defensive midfielder has endured a mixed season since making a €100 million (£85m/$107m) move from Monaco last summer. After establishing himself as a regular before the World Cup, he has seen his minutes slashed since his return from Qatar. And after losing his starting spot to Camavinga in the French national team, Tchouameni's form has been called into question.    The 23-year-old hasn't played 90 minutes since the World Cup final, and has started less than half of his possible fixtures since then. He fell out with Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti after   instead of watching his team while out injured.  Tchouameni has returned to Real Madrid training, where he will hope to be involved as Los Blancos take on Valladolid.

Paratici may have to wave goodbye to Tottenham after his ban was extended.  Tottenham are back in action for the first time since Conte's departure on Monday, April 3 against Everton at Goodison Park.

'I would like to go to England' - Tottenham-linked Luis Enrique admits he would take a Premier League job

Luis Enrique said he's looking for Premier League job, seeming to squash Paris Saint-Germain's hopes of hiring the former Barcelona boss.

 The Spaniard was let go by Spain following La Roja's round of 16 World Cup exit, and has been out of a job since then. And although Enrique revealed he has fielded offers for various national team positions, he is waiting for an opportunity to lead a Premier League side.   , Enrique asserted he is waiting for an English team for his next managerial post: "I would like to go to England to work. But I don't see myself in the Premier in July, because I would like to go to a team there that can do important things and that is very difficult. I would not go to any Premier team." Enrique also admitted that he has been reading English tabloids before a potential move: "Since the World Cup ended, I haven't read the Spanish press, I haven't seen social networks, I only read the English press. You can't pretend or like everyone or control what they say about you. The important thing is to be calm and enjoy the things you like." The former Barcelona manager is one of a handful of candidates for the Tottenham job after they  . The north London club have elected not to hire a new manager until the end of the year.  Enrique will bide his time until a new managerial role crops up. And with the Spurs gig open, he certainly seems to be in the mix.


Oh, Canada? Cyle Larin calls nation CONCACAF's 'big boys' despite USMNT & Mexico having better track records

Canada forward Cyle Larin called his nation the "big boys" of CONCACAF in a sly dig at Mexico and the United States men's national team.

The on-loan Real Valladolid striker scored a brace as Canada downed Honduras 4-1 on Tuesday night to make it two wins from their opening two Nations League matches. Despite their opponents currently placing 81st in the   - some 28 worse off than Canada - Larin said the dominant victory meant his side were now the force to be reckoned with in the confederation. "It's fun playing with these guys, I enjoy it," the 27-year-old told   after the match. "I went to Spain and they welcomed me very well, I'm enjoying it there and scoring goals there. I have to keep working hard to do that, and that translates to the national team. I know the last few times we played Honduras we tied here, and then we lost away, so it was important to win this game and show that we're at a different level to these guys. I mean, we're the big boys, if we're going to go and play against the guys and do what we did in qualifying." Tuesday's brace took Larin's tally up to 25 goals in 57 appearances for Canada. Both he and Jonathan David have helped build a formidable partnership which saw the Canucks qualify for only their second-ever World Cup in Qatar, only to crash out bottom of Group F on zero points.  But the on-loan Valladolid forward will hope those comments don't come to haunt him when the three CONCACAF "big boys" co-host the 2026 tournament. Canada certainly is on the upswing, however the USMNT and Mexico have better historical records in major competitions and boast better FIFA rankings (13th and ninth, respectively), while  . The Canada forward will return to Spain for Valladolid's next match in La Liga, which comes against second-placed Real Madrid on Sunday.

Curacao goalkeeper Eloy Room was all smiles despite letting in seven goals against Argentina, as he received a glowing review from Lionel Messi.

I need those saves for YouTube!" While Room did well to keep the scores to just seven, Messi was once again the star of the show with an assist to go  .

From missing out on Jude Bellingham to selling Mo Salah: The potentially COLOSSAL cost of Liverpool failing to finish in the top four

The Reds are in real danger of failing to qualify for next season's Champions League, which would represent a hammer blow to their finances

It's top-four or bust for Liverpool this season, then. Having played for everything last term, the Reds find themselves scrapping for the bare minimum this time around. They were out of the title race by October, and by the end of January they had been eliminated from both the Carabao Cup and FA Cup.  but of even greater concern now will be the fear that Jurgen Klopp's side could miss out on qualification for next season's competition.

"I had a positive mentality," the Udinese striker tells  . "I thought, 'I'm tall, I'm strong, I'm fast   and you can't train these things.' If you're slow, you'll always be slow. "So, I thought, 'I have these skills – the techniques and the intelligence of the game, these things I can learn and improve.' So, from there, with this self-confidence, I started to develop. "I even told my team-mates, 'I will become a footballer', and I am proud of this fact. In my opinion, if you don't believe in yourself, nobody else will. "So, one day, when my team-mates and I were warming up, they were teasing me about this and they said, 'Okay, let's make a bet, then: in five years you will be a professional?' "I said, 'Okay, fine.' "And I did it – and after only four years!'"

Lionel Messi told to STAY at PSG to boost 2026 World Cup chances by Argentina legend Mario Kempes

Lionel Messi has been advised by Argentina legend Mario Kempes to remain at Paris Saint-Germain, as talk of a return to Barcelona rumbles on.

The seven-time Ballon d’Or winner continues to run down his contract at Parc des Princes, with free agency set to be hit this summer if no fresh terms are agreed.  , and 1978 World Cup winner Kempes – who saw Messi emulate those efforts when capturing a global crown at Qatar 2022 – believes remaining in France would leave the all-time great better prepared for another World Cup bid in 2026.

For the Champions League, it is costing him a bit. At PSG, in three years, he will be perfect. We will also see him in the qualifiers. Little by little, we will see Messi’s physical rhythm. There is one thing in which Messi beats everyone: he runs when he has to run. It’s not that he runs to vice. No. If he continues with this winning mentality, it will be like that. He will not arrive like now in 2022, but with his left foot he has one hand and can put it anywhere.” While Messi is being advised to sign a new deal in Paris, questions continue to be asked of how committed he is to the PSG cause. With that in mind, there have been suggestions that he   – if Barca can find the funds required to do a deal – or take on a new challenge in MLS or the Middle East. Messi has, having initially hinted at international retirement after the 2022 World Cup, stated that he will be prolonging his   through to another global gathering in

'You talk absolute sh*t!' - Matty Cash lashes out at former Poland international after 'show you care' Aston Villa return rant

Matty Cash lashed out at former Poland international Tomasz Hajto after the pundit criticised the full-back for returning to Aston Villa early.

Cash picked up an injury in the ninth minute of Poland's 2024 European Championship qualifier against the Czech Republic last week and had to be replaced by FC Augsburg's Robert Gumny in the right-back position.

‘Talk about anointing!’ - Folarin Balogun warned he is not a guaranteed starter for USMNT as Alexi Lalas joins allegiance debate

Folarin Balogun has been warned by Alexi Lalas that he will not be a guaranteed USMNT starter if he pledges allegiance to the land of his birth.

The highly-rated 21-year-old striker is currently caught up in  . Balogun was born in New York, but moved across the Atlantic at the age of two and has represented England’s U21 side on 13 occasions. He withdrew from the latest Young Lions squad, before heading to Orlando, and is now being tipped to commit his future to an American side that is already counting down the days until it fills a co-hosting role at the 2026 World Cup finals. Balogun would be a welcome addition to the USMNT ranks, but Lalas has told his   that the youngster should not expect to walk straight into the starting XI. He has said: “I mean, so talk about anointing, right? I mean, it's as if, basically, he has a starting position. He has, you know, the keys to the city and all the cities when it comes to America. No, I mean, just the decision, it becomes and hopefully it does because he is a good quality player, just the decision is great. But then you have to actually get into it. And we have seen players that just because their pedigree was good doesn't necessarily mean they come into the national team and they live up to it. “I hope that he does, because that is a position of need. But don't think for a second that others aren't going to challenge him, even with less pedigree or less experienced going forwards. It's a good thing, but I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get into it. But it looks good for now, and we've wooed him to the extent that we can or even should and you know now we'll see if all that wooing pays off with him blessing us with his presence going forward.'” Balogun  , but he has been starring on loan at Ligue 1 side Reims this season – with 18 goals recorded for them through 29 appearances in all competitions.  in a bid to keep him on their side, with senior coach Gareth Southgate and U21 boss Lee Carsley both being asked about the promising frontman, but the   that they have done enough to lure a hot prospect back to his homeland.


Ansu Fati's father is right: Barcelona's 'new Lionel Messi' needs to quit Camp Nou

The forward's love for the club is obvious but a parting of the ways would be best for everyone involved at this stage.

The circumstances in which Bori Fati could have ended his son's Barcelona career were quite extraordinary. Bori, Ansu's father and agent,  , to air out a number of grievances about his son's situation at Barcelona. He complained about Ansu's lack of playing time, he railed against bigger roles handed to other players. And, perhaps most importantly, Bori called on his son to leave the club he joined as a teenager.  and may release a statement of his own, reaffirming his love for Barca. But the damage may already be done. At the very least, it's another negative development in what should have been a momentous career from a footballer who is still growing. Indeed, at a time when he should be looking forward to starting against Elche on Saturday, with Raphinha suspended and Ousmane Dembele injured, he is instead dealing with a furore over his future. It's quite the fall from grace. Just two years ago, remember, Fati was hailed as Barcelona's 'new Lionel Messi' and even handed the No.10 shirt. Now, he can't even nail down a starting spot. He isn't the first teenager to be boxed into the Argentine's influence at Barcelona. Indeed, a string of young talents have been dubbed the second coming of the club legend. Still, Fati was supposed to be the one that panned out. He was never going to reach Messi's talent, influence or production – no one can. But he appeared, at the very least, to be trending in the right direction. And now, Fati might slip into a familiar Barcelona trap, another failure in a handful of promising attacking players to see their careers flatlined by expectation. It might be time for the immensely talented 20-year-old to get out of Camp Nou before that can happen.

What I want is for him to play, to be on the pitch, to be happy. I would like him to continue playing. The 102 goals. I hope there are more. It deserves all the recognition. It's good that it was on Argentine soil and that also has a special value.” Messi has  , with another notable milestone passed during an international friendly outing against Curacao that saw him bag a first-half hat-trick, while he is also now  .

In England or Spain.” Havertz went on to say that joining Bayern in 2020 was “almost a bit too boring” having already shown what he is capable of in the Bundesliga, with a switch to England at that point in his career considered to be “just right”. Havertz, who is tied to a contract through to 2025, has taken in 128 appearances for Chelsea and scored 32 goals – with the most notable of those seeing him record match-winning efforts in the finals of the 2021 Champions League and  .


Ilkay Gundogan has NOT agreed Barcelona transfer but his future is 'open', says Man City star's agent

Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan is open to a move away this summer, but a Barcelona deal isn't set in stone yet.

 Gundogan was rumoured to  , but his agent denied that there's an agreement in place.

He bagged the goal that won his team the title at the Etihad last year, his fourth Premier League crown in a City shirt. Gundogan will hope to be involved when Man City take on Liverpool this Saturday. His long term future, though, is unclear.


Djordje Petrovic: Why Man Utd and Liverpool are interested in New England Revolution's latest star goalkeeper

GOAL sits down with the Serbian shot-stopper to discuss life in MLS and the persistent links to some of the game's biggest clubs.

In February 2022,  Just over a year on, the Revs could soon find themselves in a similar position. That's because Turner's replacement has rapidly caught the eye of Europe's biggest clubs, meaning it's only a matter of time before he moves on too. Manchester United and Liverpool are the two most notable teams linked with Djordje Petrovic, the Revs' No.1 with No.99 on his shirt. The 23-year-old has become a legitimate star in New England, earning a nomination for MLS Goalkeeper of the Year despite only taking over as starter in May. A big move seems inevitable for Petrovic. And, when that big move does come, there's belief that Petrovic won't just head to Europe to make up the numbers, but rather to start for a club at the highest level of the game. "When two great teams like that are interested in you, that's great," Petrovic tells  , "but I'm not paying too much attention to it because I'm happy here with the New England Revolution and I'm happy with my improvement and the way I work with the team from week to week. "When the right time comes [to think about a transfer], then we'll see." Below,  explains precisely why some of the biggest clubs in world football are following Petrovic's progress...


Man Utd debt RISES to £535m as Glazer family unrest grows amid £6bn takeover saga

Manchester United have published their financial results, with debts rising to £535.7 million ($660m) amid their lengthy takeover process.

Those figures are up from £477.1m ($588m), with   year-on-year. Commercial revenue for the Premier League heavyweights has risen by 22.2% to £78.7m ($97m), with matchday income taking a hit despite record sales of tickets, hospitality, membership and broadcasting rights. Despite plenty of numbers heading into the red, United have posted a net profit of £6.3m in the last quarter – which included the 2022 World Cup break – and expect total revenue to be between £590m ($728m) and £610m ($752m) by the time their next results are delivered. United said in a statement: “Commercial revenue for the quarter was £78.7 million, an increase of £14.3 million, or 22.2%, over the prior year quarter. Sponsorship revenue was £50.4 million, an increase of £15.2 million, or 43.2%, over the prior year quarter due to the impact of our training kit agreement with Tezos, together with a one-off sponsorship credit. “Retail, Merchandising, Apparel & Product Licensing revenue was £28.3 million, a decrease of £0.9 million, or 3.1%, over the prior year quarter. Broadcasting revenue for the quarter was £58.7 million, a decrease of £27.7 million, or 32.1%, over the prior year quarter, primarily due to the men’s first team participating in the UEFA Europa League compared to the UEFA Champions League in the prior year. Matchday revenue for the quarter was £29.9 million, a decrease of £4.7 million, or 13.6%, over the prior year quarter, due to playing two less home games in the current year quarter compared to the prior year quarter.” United added that “total operating expenses for the quarter were £167.6 million, a decrease of £12.1 million, or 6.7%, over the prior year quarter”, but they do have a season ticket waiting list of 145,000 people and their enduring appeal should help to keep the turnstiles and cash registers ticking over. United may be under new ownership by the time their next set of financial results are released, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe – Britain's richest man – and Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad Al Thani having  , while   that the Glazer family hopes will eventually be worth around £6 billion ($7.4bn).


‘Sign Kaoru Mitoma & get rid of Jadon Sancho’ – Man Utd urged to launch Brighton transfer raid by Paul Parker

Manchester United have been advised by Paul Parker to sign Kaoru Mitoma in the next transfer window, while offloading Jadon Sancho.

The Red Devils spent big on England international winger Sancho during the summer of 2021, with a £75 million ($93m) deal put in place with Borussia Dortmund. The 23-year-old has   – scoring just 10 goals and finding himself   earlier this season – and Parker believes United should be looking to upgrade in the wide attacking department by prising Japan international Mitoma away from Premier League rivals Brighton. Former Red Devils defender Parker, who won two league titles during his time at Old Trafford, has told   of Mitoma: “I really like him. He is very direct and he wants to go on the outside of his opponent, which is a rarity in today’s football. No defender wants that and he is very good at that. Mitoma would also be a very good PR-signing. To see a Japanese player at Man United would be a huge story. “I would love to see him at Man United but then they have to offload some of their wingers and they could start with getting rid of Jadon Sancho. I would rather have Mitoma in the squad than him. He has proven himself in the Premier League and I doubt that Sancho will ever do that. I think he should go back to Germany and play in his comfort zone where he is best. But if he comes to the club, Man United needs to figure out what to do with Marcus Rashford, who is best at the left wing. But that’s a luxury problem to have two good wingers.” Mitoma has   for Brighton this season, with Parker claiming that he would be a better option for United than World Cup-winning forward Ousmane Dembele of Barcelona. Asked if he would look to  , Parker added: “No, I would definitely not want to have Ousmane Dembele at Man United. He is always injured and he hasn’t proved himself at a big club. He did well at Dortmund but hasn’t done it at Barcelona yet, so he is not a player that I would want. I don’t think he is better than the wingers they already have and that says a lot about him because it isn’t the most difficult thing to be better than Jadon Sancho and Antony. He is predictable and I have to say no to him at Man United. Wherever he goes, the manager needs to make him into a different animal than what he is now.” United are expected to be busy in the next transfer window, but a new No.9 is considered to be top of their wish list – amid   – and it remains to be seen whether Ten Hag looks to invest heavily again in another option on the flanks.


Will Tyler Adams play for Leeds again this season? Injury update on USMNT star following hamstring surgery

Tyler Adams may have played his last game for Leeds in the 2022-23 campaign, with the USMNT star having undergone hamstring surgery.

The 24-year-old midfielder   on March 18. That setback ruled him out of the latest United States squad – where he has been captaining his country – while also delivering a serious blow to Leeds’ ongoing bid to steer clear of relegation danger. There is a chance that Adams could return this term but, with only 11 games left to take in, Whites boss Javi Gracia concedes that   may have been brought to a premature conclusion.  Gracia has said when asked for an update on Adams: “Tyler, we'll see his evolution but after this surgery we'll see if he can play any games this season. Day-by-day.” Leeds are managing a number of knocks at present, with their Spanish coach adding: “There are other players, Max Wober, Willy Gnonto with different injuries. Hamstring injury and ankle injury and we'll see their evolution but they need time to recover, they will be out of the team [against Arsenal].” Pressed further on whether timescales could be put on the respective recoveries of Adams, Gnonto and Co, Gracia said: “I'm sorry but I cannot clarify because I don't know. What I know is they are out for this game and I think it will be more time. I don't if one week more, two weeks more, I cannot tell you. It depends on the evolution.” Adams will definitely be missing for Leeds when they return to action with a testing trip to Premier League leaders Arsenal on Saturday, with the games then coming thick and fast for the Whites as they head into back-to-back home dates with fellow strugglers Nottingham Forest and Crystal Palace.

FIFA streamer Castro: Alphonso Davies beat me on FIFA & this is what it's like to see Lionel Messi lift the World Cup in person

Twitch streamer Castro also revealed his favourite FIFA games and described how he took a taxi driver to watch the World Cup

FIFA streamer Castro spoke with  about his experiences in the world of online gaming, with his streaming career thrusting him into the world of the real life game. Castro started streaming with FIFA 14, and has seen his brand grow in the nearly 10 years since. At this point, he regularly plays against real-world superstars, something that doesn't always go well for the streamer with nearly four million Twitch followers. "The best professional player I've ever actually played against is Alphonso Davies. He actually beat me, I don't want to say that out loud!" Castro said. "David Luiz was very good as well, Marco Reus, too." Davies and Castro have since developed a friendship, and Castro speculated he might have a gaming career to come after he hangs up his boots. "He could enter a FIFA tournament someday and potentially win it," Castro said. But he hasn't completed the full range of superstars he wants to get on the sticks with. Another Brazilian is also on his list. "Someone I would love to play some day would probably be Neymar. I know that he's big on gaming. I I'm not sure how good he is at FIFA, but obviously he's quality on the pitch!" Castro said. The long-time streamer also spoke on some of his World Cup experiences, including inviting his Taxi driver to Mexico's World Cup win over Saudi Arabia. "I took him there, and something special finally happened: I got to witness Mexico score in the World Cup," the devout El Tri fan added. But the big Cristiano Ronaldo fan also revealed he was disappointed to see Portugal lose. "It's not the way I would have wanted to see Ronaldo get knocked out of his potentially last World Cup," Castro said. Still, Castro's eyes are very much on the future - notably, the 2026 World Cup. "A lot of young players are going to be shining like crazy," he said.

Real Madrid outcast Eden Hazard 'physically outmatched' in training game with Castilla squad

Real Madrid outcast Eden Hazard was reportedly "physically outmatched" in a training game with the club's Castilla squad this week.

Hazard, who had some time off during the international break after   following the 2022 World Cup, took part in a training game at Real Madrid on Thursday that saw the first-team mix with Castilla players. According to  , the 32-year-old was way off the pace physically during the contest and had difficulty dribbling past any of his opponents, with head coach Carlo Ancelotti watching on from the sidelines.

The former Chelsea winger still has one year left on his contract and  , but speculation over a potential summer exit continues to rage.

USMNT up-and-comer Caden Clark could go out on loan, says RB Leipzig's Marco Rose

USMNT rising star Caden Clark could go out on loan next season, admitted RB Leipzig boss Marco Rose.

Clark finally joined up with RB Leipzig in January, having spent last season on loan with the New York Red Bulls after signing with the German side in 2021. He's made the bench several times, but has yet to see the field, and Rose admitted that Clark could go out on loan next season in search of consistent minutes.  "We might think about getting him playing time at another club," Rose said. "He's doing well, but we need patience. He's a great footballer with good basic technique who recognizes a lot of things, but, with his decision-making, there's still a lot of untapped potential, and we'll work on that with him." Clark is expected to be a part of the U20s men's national team squad for the World Cup, which is set to kick off in May. It remains to be seen where it will kick off, though, as FIFA stripped Indonesia of hosting rights on Wednesday. RB Leipzig, who currently sit fifth in the Bundesliga, will play host to Mainz on Saturday before then hosting Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday in the DFB-Pokal quarterfinal.

USMNT player ratings vs El Salvador: Ricardo Pepi is BACK with another goal as striker makes instant impact

It took time for the U.S. to get in the groove but they eventually got the goal they needed vs El Salvador, thanks to a delicious chip from El Tren.

While there were banners all around the stadium in honor of the U.S. men's national team's potential striker of the future, a player that once held that title proved that he still has plenty to say about the ongoing No. 9 race. Ricardo Pepi came off the bench and, within two minutes, scored himself a game-winning goal, leading the U.S. to a 1-0 victory over El Salvador at Exploria Stadium in Orlando. With the win, the U.S. advance to the semifinals of the Nations League, where they will look to defend the crown they won in 2021. That trophy came before the emergence of Pepi, who arrived on the scene later that fall. In the time since, he's gone from striker of the present and future to World Cup roster cut and, now, all the way back. Having scored three goals in two games this window, Pepi's confidence appears to be back, and that's good news for the USMNT even with the potential arrival of Folarin Balogun looming large.  rates the USMNT's players from Exploria Stadium...


Welcome back, Ricardo Pepi and Miles Robinson! USMNT Winners and Losers as duo puts World Cup disappointment behind them with star performances vs El Salvador

Two players that missed the World Cup stole the show as the U.S. took down El Salvador to book their spot in the Nations League semifinals

If this match was anything to go by, the U.S. men's national team probably missed both Ricardo Pepi and Miles Robinson at the World Cup. Both missed out on Qatar for different reasons: Robinson due to an Achilles injury and Pepi due to a total loss of form and confidence following a failed move to Augsburg. But both are now very much back in the picture, having put in incredible performances in the 1-0 win over El Salvador. It served as a reminder of what many people already knew: that these two are over their terrible 2022 and back to the form that might them so vital just one year prior. Both look to have big futures, both in 2023 in beyond, with both emerging as big winners from this match and this camp. On a night where the USMNT was slightly lethargic, both provided what was neccessary to see off a very game El Salvador team that, at times, looked ready to steal a result. They ultimately didn't and, because of that, the USMNT are onto the Nations League semifinals. Will we see Pepi and Robinson there? Almost certainly. After some time away, both are right back in the mix.


'I'm gonna be in big, big trouble!' - USMNT and Arsenal star Matt Turner excited to be a girl dad after teammates and family gather for gender reveal after win over El Salvador

Matt Turner admitted that he thinks he's in big trouble as the U.S. men's national team goalkeeper found out he and his wife are having a baby girl.

Turner's USMNT teammates and family gathered after the 1-0 win over El Salvador as the goalkeeper and his wife found out the gender of their baby. Turner booted a ball filled with pink smoke before a jubilant celebration of USMNT stars, with the goalkeeper and his wife now awaiting the birth of their baby girl. The couple already have a son who will turn one in July, and Turner is now eager to welcome a baby girl to the family after Monday's big reveal. IT’S A GIRL 💕💕💕💕 Congrats to   and the fam! 💜  The moment was made more special by the presence of Turner's teammates and family, who were on hand to celebrate the moment. The goalkeeper hasn't gotten too much time to spend with his relatives in the States since moving to Arsenal, and he was glad to have so many loved ones around for such a special moment. "20 or so people from my family came down here. Family time is really important to my wife and I and being in London, it's few and far between. Obviously, we're chasing this crazy dream over there. That takes away from her being close to her family, because when we were in Boston, she's from Maine, and me being only a three hour drive from New Jersey. To be able to come here and for U.S. Soccer to be so flexible to allow us to do that, it's just a really special moment for us and I'm super excited to be a girl dad!" Turner will now head back to Arsenal to chase that "crazy dream", which is centered around the Premier League title race. The Gunners currently have an eight-point lead over Mancehster City, who do have a game in hand. It won't take long for Turner to reunite with some USMNT teammates in England, as Arsenal are set to face Brenden Aaronson, Weston McKennie, Tyler Adams and Leeds this weekend.


'I think I made a big statement tonight' - USMNT's Ricardo Pepi joins elite company in Christian Pulisic and Jozy Altidore with another goal

Ricardo Pepi's latest goal helped the U.S. men's national team take down El Salvador while placing the striker in elite company in the history books.

Pepi scored just two minutes after coming on in Friday's 1-0 win over El Salvador, following up a performance that saw him net twice in a 7-1 win over Grenada. With the three finishes this week, Pepi now has six senior goals for the U.S., making him the third-youngest USMNT player to reach that mark. Pepi is only 20 years and 77 days old, meaning only Christian Pulisic (18 years, 263 days) and Jozy Altidore (19 years, 146 days) were younger when scoring their sixth national team goal. It's been a long road back for Pepi, who, at one point in 2021, looked like he would be a starter for the 2022 World Cup. He ended up falling out of the picture entirely due to a disastrous move to Augsburg, but the striker is now back scoring goals for Groningen and, most importantly, for his country. "It's been a roller coaster, to be honest," Pepi said. "I'm happy to be just in the squad scoring goals again after missing the World Cup. I think I made a big statement tonight. I'm just happy to be out there fighting with my teammates again and helping them out." The striker will now head back to Groningen, where he could feature as soon as this weekend when the Dutch side visits Fortuna Sittard. Pepi has 10 goals this season for Groningen, who enter the weekend in 17th place, which, if it holds, would see the club relegated.


Forget Mo Salah and Rodrygo - Bukayo Saka is the best right winger in the world!

The Arsenal and England winger is setting new standards this season for club and country 

Gareth Southgate bit his lip when he was asked after   whether there was any other right winger in the world who is playing at the level of Bukayo Saka right now. “I’m not going to get drawn into where he sits in world football,” Southgate laughed. “That would start to put us in danger of doing all the things that we shouldn’t be doing with him.  “He’s progressing brilliantly and he’s a joy to work with. We should leave it at that.” It was as diplomatic a response as you would expect from someone like Southgate.  But in all honesty,  . Mohamed Salah can step aside, so can the likes of Ousmane Dembele and Rodrygo. Saka is currently the best right winger on the planet. It’s that simple.


Man Utd dealt ANOTHER midfield injury blow as Marcel Sabitzer sustains knee problem while on Austria duty

Marcel Sabitzer is the latest Manchester United midfielder to sustain an injury, the club announced on Monday.

Arsenal suffer Thomas Partey injury worry ahead of crucial Leeds United clash

Thomas Partey will fly back to Arsenal having missed Ghana's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Angola on Monday due to injury.

Ghana manager Chris Houghton confirmed Partey, who remained an unused substitute during the 1-1 draw, was deemed too much of a risk to play during his post-match press conference. “Thomas has some small injury issues," Houghton said.

Arsenal travel to Liverpool the following weekend for a huge game at Anfield as they chase their first Premier League title since 2004.

Tottenham SLAMMED for not being ‘built for winning’ as ex-Spurs star Jamie Redknapp ‘not surprised’ Antonio Conte failed to succeed

Jamie Redknapp has criticised Tottenham for not being "built for winning" while insisting he was "not surprised" by Antonio Conte's failure.

The Italian manager   on Sunday following his   after being held to a 3-3 draw against bottom-placed Southampton on March 18. Redknapp blasted Spurs following the departure of the manager and insisted that the club lacks a winning mentality. "I "It’s a very difficult club to manage and it always has been. If you look at the managers they’ve gone through in the last few years, they almost bang their heads against a brick wall and find it very difficult to ever get any control of that club. "It’s very much controlled by Daniel Levy - he wants to make all the decisions and I think that’s always been a major problem with Tottenham. The culture, I believe, is always set from the top. This trophy drought isn’t just about the stadium. When I was at the club I felt it wasn’t really built for winning. It was a completely different culture to what I’d been at with Liverpool." Despite coming down heavily on the club and chairman Levy, Redknapp thought it was best for the club to part ways with Conte after the manager went public with his grievances following the Southampton draw. "I said after the game against Southampton that Antonio Conte's position became untenable," he added. "Not so much among the players because a lot of what he said he’s said before to the players. I think it was more when he spoke about the culture at the club and speaking about the last 15 years. He can’t be speaking about the players because those players haven’t really been there that long - you can’t really blame them. But when he said what he said I think his position became untenable with the owners." Cristian Stellini will replace Conte on the touchline when Spurs resume Premier League action following the international break away at Everton on April 3.


‘We believe in him’ – USMNT won’t give up on Gio Reyna following World Cup rows & attitude questions

Gio Reyna is an important part of the United States set up, according to Anthony Hudson, with the USMNT’s interim coach saying: “We believe in him.”

Questions were asked of where the highly-rated Borussia Dortmund playmaker would fit into plans heading forwards following a number of unfortunate headlines that were made on the back of the 2022 World Cup finals. His   in Qatar, with limited game time taken in as a result, while his   in   with former U.S. boss Gregg Berhalter. While there have been plenty of distractions for Reyna over recent months, he was involved in CONCACAF Nations League games with Grenada and El Salvador during the latest international break –   – and Hudson has said of his role: “Gio's performance overall, I thought was really good. I thought he showed flashes of being our biggest attacking threat. These CONCACAF games, when you're playing in the opposition's half and there's no space between the backline and the midfield, it can make it difficult. “We believe in him. Clearly he has talent and you can see it with some of the things he does. He probably needs a few more games under his belt. Tyler Adams not being here affects that sort of double pivot. He's someone who would have been perfect in that, but listen, we're pleased. We're pleased with what he's done. We're very, very pleased with how he's been this week in training. I think we're all just in a position where we want to keep looking forward.” Reyna will now be returning to Germany to link back up with a Dortmund side that sits top of the Bundesliga table with nine games left to take in this season. Reyna has registered five goals and two assists for BVB in the 2022-23 campaign and will be hoping to deliver more end product heading into a quest for CONCACAF Gold Cup glory with the USMNT this summer.

He was   in the first of those outings, but was replaced in the second and has been feeling a little under the weather as he prepares to rejoin a Premier League survival battle in England. Hudson told reporters of McKennie after taking him off in the closing stages of a narrow  : “Weston has been great. I think he had a little bit of a fever tonight. Coming off, I went to give him a hug and I just refrained myself from getting anywhere near him because he's having some struggles. He was struggling a little bit tonight, flu wise, but he did it. He's been great all cam. He's now becoming one of, and this is crazy to say, one of the senior guys in the team and it is really good to have him around the camp.” McKennie has seen fellow countryman  , ruling him out of action for the USMNT and Leeds, and will be hoping to help cover the absence of a stricken colleague when the Whites take in a testing trip to Premier League leaders Arsenal on Saturday. McKennie’s loan deal at Leeds does include the option for a permanent transfer to be pushed through this summer, but they will need to preserve their top-flight status in order to trigger that clause and   is already being  .

Man Utd legend Wayne Rooney begs Eddie Hearn for celebrity boxing fight after having ‘a few glasses of red’

Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney often begs to star in his own celebrity boxing match after a “few glasses of red”, Eddie Hearn has revealed.

The former England captain, who has lost his all-time goal record with the Three Lions to Harry Kane but remains the  , has never tried to hide his love of combat sports. He famously delivered a knockout goal celebration while still on the books at Old Trafford and is an avid follower of events that take place inside the ring. Hearn - as the lead man at Matchroom Boxing - could help Rooney to lace up a pair of gloves, and would welcome the opportunity to do so, but the current boss of D.C. United tends to rein in his ambition after a night on the drink. Hearn has told the  : “Rooney can fight, I’ve spoken to Wayne. When Wayne has a drink, he’ll message me and he’ll start going, ‘I’ll fight him and I’ll fight him,’ and I get excited. Sometimes I get a message from Wayne saying, ‘Make me vs so and so, make that fight.’ I’ll look at it in the morning and go, ‘This is massive’. So I’ll message him back, ‘Few glasses of red or [are you serious?]’. Then he won’t reply and I’ll go, ‘Damn.’ But Wayne can fight.” YouTube personality KSI, who often tries his hand at boxing, has claimed in the past that Rooney has floated the idea of appearing on one of his cards, while heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has stated in the past that – as an avid United supporter – he would be  Boxing Day 😉🥊  ||    For now, Rooney is focused on football matters in MLS – while also preparing to   in an exhibition match this summer – but his love of boxing will continue and there may be more messages for Hearn to contend with yet.


Erling Haaland injury update: Pep Guardiola reveals Manchester City striker COULD play in Liverpool clash as he faces crucial final training session

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola admitted it is not yet certain whether star forward Erling Haaland will be fit to face Liverpool on Saturday.

The 22-year-old had been on fine form for City  , with a staggering nine goals in his last three goals across all competitions. But Haaland   due to a groin problem and therefore missed their European qualifiers against Spain and Georgia.  “Erling [Haaland] is recovering," the City boss told reporters, "this afternoon we have the last training session and we are going to see how he feels. We’ll see today. At the end, the doctors and the player will decide how he feels, I spoke with him, he feels good. We will see. Life is risk in these stages, we have to take it.” With a whopping 42 goals already to his name this season, the Norwegian's absence would be a hammer blow for Guardiola as they prepare for a potential season-defining matchup in Saturday's early kick-off.   having played a game less, anything but three points would see the title edge closer towards north London, meaning Haaland's inclusion could be crucial. Liverpool, meanwhile, will still be eyeing a top-four position as they sit seven points below Tottenham but with two games in hand. Anything but a victory for Jurgen Klopp's side could put that finish in jeopardy, though, with the  . The Norwegian is therefore still a doubt for a match which  . Should Haaland not feature against Liverpool, he will at least be hoping to be reintroduced to the fray by the time City travel to Southampton a week later.


‘Why now?’ - England’s James Maddison opens up on World Cup injury woes after first cap in three years against Ukraine

James Maddison opened up on his 2022 World Cup injury woes after winning his first cap for England in three years against Ukraine.

The Leicester City midfielder was called up by Gareth Southgate as part of England's squad for the 2022 World Cup. However, he was omitted from the first two matchday squads due to an injury he picked up against West Ham just before the tournament, and had to settle for being an unused substitute after returning to full fitness as England made it to the quarter-finals. Maddison has now admitted to enduring "tough times" in Qatar on the back of an unfortunate injury setback. He told reporters: "There was a lot of sad faces when I was in my room in Qatar by myself, thinking: ‘Why? Why now, this little injury, when I’ve worked so hard to get to the World Cup with everyone clamouring for me to be in the squad?’. There were tough times in my room in Qatar, FaceTiming home. It was almost like a battle with myself to say: ‘Don’t take this for granted. I might not be able to shake this injury off, but it will leave me in good stead if I show Gareth [Southgate] and the people who have questioned my personality that that’s all rubbish. I get on so well with the lads and the staff. What you see from the outside is exactly how it is. I hoped stuff like that would leave me in good stead, and it probably has." Maddison was rewarded for his mental toughness on Sunday as Southgate handed him his first cap for England since 2019 in  . "It felt great. It almost felt like a second debut," he said. "I know that doesn’t really work, but it feels a lifetime ago since that Montenegro game [in November 2019]. It felt brilliant. It’s refreshing to be out there with the lads in a strong team and a big game. I really enjoyed it. I love football — I always say it. I’ve worked hard, waited a long time for that opportunity. It feels like I’ve just been waiting so long to get the manager’s trust, and hopefully I repaid it with my performance." Maddison added on being deployed in a left-wing role instead of centre midfield: "People might [have looked] at the lineup and seen that Maddison’s on the left wing. How’s that going to work? But it’s actually a really nice position for a player like me, especially when you have Ben Chilwell at left-back, who’s such a good runner and such a threat. Gareth said to me, ‘Play with freedom, you have the licence to play in the pockets just as you do for Leicester’. It just gave me that freedom. I didn’t feel restricted. I’ll watch the game back and I’ll probably nit-pick. I probably should have scored to be honest, but I’ll try and enjoy the moment." The midfielder will now shift his focus back to Leicester City, who are struggling in the 17th place in the Premier League table and set to make a trip to Selhurst Park on Saturday to take on Crystal Palace.

WATCH: Lionel Messi's FULL spat with Wout Weghorst at 2022 World Cup revealed in explosive new footage

Footage has emerged showing Lionel Messi’s full spat with Wout Weghorst at the end of Argentina’s World Cup quarter-final win over the Netherlands.

 A fiery contest in Qatar between the Albiceleste and Oranje delivered 18 yellow cards and one red, with the eventual winners of the entire competition ultimately prevailing in a nerve-shredding penalty shootout.

Virgil van Dijk accused of 'creating chaos' for the Netherlands as Marco van Basten questions Liverpool star's captaincy credentials

Virgil van Dijk's captaincy credentials have been questioned by Marco van Basten, who says the defender "creates chaos" for the Netherlands team.

Although the   over Gibraltar in Euro 2024 qualifying on Monday, Dutch legend Van Basten was still not over   three days earlier, and singled out Van Dijk for criticism. The Liverpool star's penchant for "making noise" instead of dishing out "clear" instructions to his team-mates has been a major source of frustration for Van Basten, who has expressed doubt over his ability to lead the national team. "He makes noise, but he doesn't say anything. He is not clear. A good captain thinks aloud, makes it clear what is going on. He stays in between. He creates chaos. That leads to misunderstandings. That is what you, as a captain, must prevent," he told  "In the dressing room he is good, football tactically and technically not. You need another gentleman on the field. This has to do with leadership. He makes noise, but he says nothing. That's true. This is in you. This is wanting to win at all costs." When Van Dijk was asked to respond to Van Basten's comments after the Gibraltar game, he said to  : “This is of no use to me. Everyone is allowed to have their own opinion these days. Did I set the bar unrealistically high? How is that possible? It was never perfect, consistent is the right word. We’ve had a lot of success with the team. Football players, they know that better than anyone, have high peaks and deep lows. It’s quite normal that you can’t always play consistently. "That you have a phase as a club or player where you are looking for your level. People should not forget that. It is normal that people make mistakes, that it is part of football and that it is very human. Regardless of who gets a platform and is allowed to say what, so that things are made big. You know better than anyone when you are doing something right or not." Van Dijk will now shift his focus back to club matters at Liverpool and is expected to be in action when the Reds make a trip to the Etihad Stadium to take on Manchester City on April 1.

Confirmed: Barcelona ARE in talks to re-sign Lionel Messi from PSG

A sensational return to Barcelona could be on the cards for Lionel Messi, with vice-president Rafa Yuste confirming that talks have been opened.

It appeared at one stage as though the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner was destined to sign a new contract at Paris Saint-Germain, with an offer having been on the table there since the Argentine returned from  . No deal has been done, though, and Messi continues to   as a result. There has been talk of interest being shown in the all-time great from MLS and the Middle East, but strong professional ties to Camp Nou mean that   could take the 35-year-old back to Catalunya. Yuste has said of returning Messi to his roots at Barca, after bidding an emotion farewell to the mercurial South American in 2021: “I participated in the negotiations that sadly weren’t successful. I am still frustrated that Leo couldn’t continue playing for this club. If we talk about the Masia academy and youth players, we are talking about Leo. He arrived here when he was 12 years old. Of course, I would love to have him back. I say this personally. But I think many of our supporters would love that too, for everything he would represent if he came back., not only on a sporting, economic and social level, among other issues, but also because I think that all beautiful stories must have a happy ending. And answering your question, my answer is yes. We are in contact with them (referring to Messi and his father and agent Jorge Messi).” Several prominent figures in Barcelona,  , have left the door open for Messi to return, with first team coach Xavi hoping to see his former team-mate take in a “Last Dance” at Camp Nou. He has said of  : “It will depend on many things. We are obviously at the mercy of Financial Fair Play. But I think what it will depend on most is the wishes of Leo. He knows this is his home, that the doors are open, and that we would be delighted to have him.” Xavi added: “I have seen him grow at the club, I know him, I know the magnitude of him as a footballer. He is exemplary in many aspects. It’s normal that people are excited. It’s a Last Dance like Michael Jordan. I think the best thermometer is Camp Nou to see how Cules are. That thermometer does not fail. The field is full and the people excited, people are excited on the street.” Messi cemented his standing among the global greats during his previous stint at Barcelona, scoring 672 goals for the club through 778 appearances while also helping them to 10 La Liga titles and four Champions League crowns.


'We are busy' - Jurgen Klopp issues positive Liverpool transfer update as he reveals international break talks

Jurgen Klopp says he is "positive" about Liverpool's summer transfer business, admitting talks over potential signings have already taken place.

Speaking at a press conference on Friday ahead of the Reds' Premier League clash with Manchester City, Klopp revealed the club had been "busy" during the recent international break, as they line up a series of targets for the summer window. Klopp told reporters: "That [plan for next season] is the only thing we do [during the break], apart from have a few days off. We do not plan training sessions or things like this. On the player side, I'm positive, I would say. But there are talks, not decisions. We are busy, as you can imagine." Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham remains,  understands,  , despite strong competition from the likes of Real Madrid and Manchester City.

The next Christian Pulisic or Gio Reyna? Inside Borussia Dortmund's search for the next American wonderkids in both the men's and women's game

The Bundesliga club recently welcomed its top talents from its North American academy, continuing its focus on developing future internationals

Call it scouting, call it luck, call it whatever you like, but you have to admit that Borussia Dortmund struck gold with Christian Pulisic and Gio Reyna. While many in Europe ignored the American market, Dortmund, and the Bundesliga, saw opportunity. They saw ready-made players that wouldn't require massive transfer fees, with many not requiring any at all.  That was the case for both Pulisic and Reyna, both of whom arrived in Germany on free transfers. Pulisic, meanwhile, left for the third-largest transfer fee in club history when he signed for Chelsea in a whopping €64 million (£57m/$73m). Should the club ever want to cash in on Reyna, there's no doubt that he'd go for millions as well. So, while other clubs around the world are now making their own push in the American market, Dortmund are just building on a foundation that's been laid down over the last decade or so. The hope? To find the next Pulisic or Reyna or, as they continue to expand, perhaps even the next Alex Morgan or Mallory Swanson. Dortmund, in many ways, remain committed to the U.S. and, at some point, the hope is that they'll reap the rewards once again.

Unfortunately, he feels some discomfort in his back and we are trying to manage him in the best possible way. He’s not going to be fit for this game [against Leeds] but we are trying, he is trying to do everything he can to feel better and get back training, but not yet. We don’t know if it happened the previous game as he had a very awkward landing against Fulham but before that he was fine."  When pushed on whether Saliba would be able to feature again this season, Arteta added: “Yeah, I’m very hopeful and he is as well. Back injuries are a bit tricky, how they evolve with the load in certain areas but he’s very positive about it, the medical staff are positive about it, so let’s push it every day a little bit and see how he copes with that and how the pain develops. He’s so willing to be back with the team. "Hopefully we [can] get the right load for him, the right amount of rest that he needs while we’re keeping him active. And the pain starts to go away and we are more comfortable with the images we have of him that we can start to take him to the pitch and do certain activities with him. That’s it."  The Gunners host Leeds United on Saturday looking to maintain their lead at the top of the table.

 Arteta was spotted in the crowd at the Emirates on Wednesday night  .

It was great to have the experience to live it there and the crowd that we had in the game, especially the way they played. In the first half it was a real joy to watch.

This is the beauty of it, getting things inside the club that are inspiring for each other and can make us closer and better.” Asked about  , he added: "Beautiful.

'Just rubbish!' - Man Utd's Wout Weghorst admits to lacking 'quality' after failing to score in Netherlands' 51-shot assault on Gibraltar net

The visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 51st minute, which further boosted the Dutch attack as they ended up recording 51 shots at goal.

The Manchester United striker also drew a blank in the Netherlands' 3-0 loss to France last Friday, and is making no excuses for his lack of cutting edge. "There were a few situations where I was close, but just not all the way. It’s just… just rubbish," Weghorst told   after the match. "Unlucky? Whether it’s just bad luck… Ultimately, it’s also quality. You have to be honest about that too. You can call it bad luck, but that last ball of mine was allowed in. As a striker you know that you can score in these kinds of competitions."  across all competitions for United since joining the club on loan from Burnley in January.

I have a lot of admiration for him, but at the same time I think: he is not good enough for Manchester United and the Orange. Every now and then you see defects," Gullit told  Weghrost will hope to turn around his fortunes if he is given the opportunity by Erik ten Hag against Newcastle United in the Premier League on Sunday.

He’s a special player, but I’ve said it before, we just need to be careful not to apply too much pressure on him but let him play football. When you let him play football you can see what he does for Dortmund, you can see what he does here for England.

Revealed: The key to Lionel Messi's Barcelona return as he seeks face-to-face meeting with Joan Laporta to bury the hatchet

Several things must fall into place if Lionel Messi is to return to Barcelona next term, including a reconciliation with president Joan Laporta.

The Argentina star sees his contract at French giants Paris Saint-Germain expire in three months' time, with  . Naturally, this has prompted countless rumours on Messi's next destination, most prominently a return to Barca, who have been  . Messi still shares a good relationship with current manager Xavi and, according to  , his family are eager for a return to Catalonia.

Gio Reyna will miss Borussia Dortmund's clash with Bayern Munich due to illness, manager Edin Terzic confirmed on Friday.

Reyna recently started both U.S. men's national team games during the international break, featuring in wins over Grenada and El Salvador.

We didn't have patience." , the Dutchman will lead his PSV side out in their Eredivisie return away at NEC Nijmegen on Saturday.


'Relax, dog!' - Arsenal's Aaron Ramsdale names USMNT star Matt Turner funniest teammate with hysterical example of goalkeeper's 'Americanisms'

Aaron Ramsdale has named Matt Turner as his funniest Arsenal teammate, although the U.S. men's national team star's humor isn't always intentional.

Huge blow for Napoli as in-form Victor Osimhen could MISS Champions League tie against AC Milan due to injury

In-form forward Victor Osimhen could miss Napoli's Champions League tie against Milan, after a muscle injury has ruled him out of Serie A action.

Serie A leaders Napoli have racked up a massive 19-point lead at the top of the table, but star striker Osimhen has been ruled out of action at a crucial period in their season.  . As a result, he's certain to miss Napoli's league fixture against Milan this weekend, and the 24-year-old remains a doubt for the following games. Unfortunately for Milan, one of these upcoming fixtures is a huge Champions League clash, also against Milan. Taking place on 12 April,   against the Rossoneri represents a huge chance for the Serie A leaders; however, it's unlikely that Osimhen will be available. Manager Luciano Spalletti will be desperate to get the Nigeria international back for the second round of the tie, but it's currently unclear how long Osimhen will be out for. but they have a fantastic opportunity to change that. While strong opponents, Milan are a beatable team, and given Napoli's electric form this season, Spalletti's side will fancy their chances. After their game against Milan in the league this Sunday, the Partenopei are off to Lecce for a Serie A match they'll be expected to win. Then comes Napoli's huge clash at San Siro, with or without Osimhen, in the Champions League quarter-finals.


Revealed: The Premier League club who spent the most on agent fees in the last year - and it's NOT Chelsea

The FA have released details about how much each Premier League club is spending on agents fees – and there are some staggering figures on show.

In the last two transfer windows, English clubs have outspent the rest of Europe by a long way. But one element of the transfer market we don't often get an insight into is the role of agents. However, that's changed with the release of new figures outlining how much each Premier League club has spent on agent fees since February 2022. And despite Chelsea's dramatic splashing of cash in the past two windows, the Blues aren't top of the list. The club that has spent the most on agent fees in the last year is Manchester City. The huge role played by agents in modern football is a point of contention for many within the game, but it's something that's unlikely to change any time soon. This data details just how much money English clubs are spending on agent fees; according to the figures, last season's champions Manchester City spent a net total of over £51m on agent fees in the last year, closely followed by Chelsea's £43m. The smallest Premier League outlay came from Nottingham Forest, who spent 4,353,186 — given that , this might come as a surprise!  The club's billionaire owner Sheikh Mansour has invested heavily since completing his takeover in September 2008. In order to secure the signings of world-class players like  , these kinds of agent fees are standard practice. And as they continue to seek league titles and European trophies, those big money transfers aren't going to be slowing down any time soon.


Lotte Wubben-Moy replaces Millie Bright in England squad for Finalissima clash against Brazil with Chelsea star to continue injury rehab at club

Arsenal defender Lotte Wubben-Moy has been called up to England's squad to face Brazil, as Chelsea's Millie Bright withdraws through injury.

Bright, meanwhile, will continue her rehabilitation with Chelsea, having been sidelined since the first leg of the Blues' UWCL quarter-final against Lyon -  England take on South America's reigning champions Brazil in the inaugural women's Finalissima, to take place next Thursday in a sold-out Wembley Stadium. Despite not featuring in the Lioness' triumphant Euros run on home soil, Wubben-Moy's call up is a reward for her defensive displays for the Gunners this term, which included an impressive showing as a first-half substitute  For Bright, though, it is confirmation on the severity of her injury, with Chelsea releasing the following statement on Friday: "The club can today confirm that defender Millie Bright has withdrawn from the England squad ahead of the Lionesses' upcoming camp. Millie is undergoing assessment on an injury sustained during our UEFA Women’s Champions League first leg fixture against Lyon on 22 March.

Kevin De Bruyne remains otherworldly! Man City midfielder leads Belgium past Germany while Leon Goretzka's injury will give Thomas Tuchel trouble

Kevin De Bruyne scored once and assisted twice as he captained his Belgium side to a historic 3-2 victory over Germany in Tuesday's friendly.

Questions were raised about Germany defensively against Peru and their openness was duly exploited by Domenico Tedesco's side on Tuesday. Kevin De Bruyne in particular was in a clinical mood, finding Yannick Carrasco in acres of space for Belgium's first before sliding through Romelu Lukaku for his fourth goal in two matches,  . Germany looked nervous in front of the Cologne crowd and Dodi Lukebakio should have sealed the victory early on, having run the length of the pitch only to shoot narrowly wide. Despite Hansi Flick's side being handed a lifeline through Niclas Fullkrug's penalty just before half-time, Germany were unable to make the most of a largely dominant second period. Leandro Trossard came on to great effect having, once again, found himself in plenty of space on the counter-attack, as he hooked a pass back for De Bruyne to finish expertly and put the match to bed. Serge Gnabry was able to grab a late consolation which made for a nervy finish, but the match ended 3-2 to give Belgium their first win over Germany in 17 attempts. That was a captain's performance from  . Germany seemed almost inexplicably exposed at times, but it still needed a master touch to thread the right ball through. Both passes to Carrasco and Lukaku were expertly timed and perfectly weighted, and the Belgium skipper was even on hand to provide a few vital defensive interceptions when his team were up against it. The fine finish on the end of Trossard's pass epitomised De Bruyne's complete display, and it was the ending his stellar performance deserved on the night. How Pep Guardiola will be looking forward to having him back for the business end of the season.  Despite the clear warning signs against Peru, it is evident that a lot of work still needs to be done by Flick to fix his side's defensive frailties. But the big loser from Tuesday night falls to another manager, as Leon Goretzka's injury means   may now be without his key midfielder for a crucial first game against Dortmund on Saturday. The Bayern star had to be hooked after just 30 minutes with what looked to be an ankle injury, as Tuchel is left sweating on his availability ahead of key fixtures in the league, as well as in Europe against Manchester City. After a pulsating victory in Tuesday's friendly match, attention now turns to club football, where Goretzka's injury could prove to be a significant loss for Tuchel's title-chasing Bayern.  ⭐


Fabio Paratici is GONE! Tottenham director of football steps back from role pending outcome of appeal against worldwide football ban

Tottenham released a statement on Friday confirming director of football Fabio Paratici has stepped down back his role at the club.

The decision comes after the ban handed to the Italian for his involvement in Juventus' recent corruption scandal  .

This decision was taken in advance of Fabio Paratici’s Appeal hearing against the FIGC sanctions on 19 April 2023, the result of which would then have been considered by additional stakeholders, including the Club. "Given FIFA’s unexpected ruling the sanctions may now have multi-jurisdictional effect, although they are still related to the FIGC Appeal. In view of FIFA’s decision, Fabio has agreed with the Club that he will take an immediate leave of absence pending the outcome of his Appeal." According to  's David Ornstein, Paratici met with Spurs players on Friday to inform them of the situation, before a joint decision was made with the club for him to step back from his duties from April 19, the date of the outcome of his appeal. The ex-director of football is just one of 11 former Juve executives to be hit with a ban, while the club themselves were handed a  The decision leaves Tottenham in disarray. The club presided over by Daniel Levy now faces a battle to find the club's managerial successor to the recently dismissed Conte, in a competitive market  . Doing so without a director of football seems an arduous, if not ill-advised, task, meaning Levy can Co will be almost immediately on the hunt for a new Spurs chief, in what looks set to be a tumultuous period of change in north London.

Explained: Portland Timbers' 'liar' controversy between goalkeeper Aljaz Ivacic and Giovanni Savarese

Injuries have plagued the Portland Timbers so far this year and now so has controversy, as goalkeeper Aljaz Ivacic is at odds with his manager.

 On Saturday evening, Portland Timbers released their starting lineup against the LA Galaxy, and surprisingly their regular starting goalkeeper, Ivacic, had been dropped from their squad entirely. The early indications were that perhaps the goalkeeper had been injured, however the goalkeeper made it clear to reporters that he was "fit to play" and claimed "everything else you’re gonna hear is a lie.”  Savarese explained his perspective on keeping out Ivacic, telling reporters: “[David] Bingham showed he was the best player on the field, and he had a great match. So, my decision was correct today to make sure I played the right player. Nevertheless, the reason was that Ivacic didn’t train enough this week, he didn’t have enough practice. He said he was ready, and personally, I didn’t feel he would be in a situation where he wouldn’t have gotten injured.”  The Timbers have just four points through five matches, which has evidently increased frustration in the locker room.  The Timbers are in action again on Saturday against FC Dallas, but it's unclear whether Ivacic will be allowed to feature.


Another USMNT star in the Bundesliga? FC Cincinnati  get call from Borussia Monchengladbach over possible Brandon Vazquez transfer

Borussia Monchengladbach are reportedly in the hunt for FC Cincinnati forward Brandon Vazquez as a possible replacement for Marcus Thuram.

With Marcus Thuram reportedly on his way out, Gladbach are already on the lookout for a replacement with  suggesting the player of choice could be FC Cincinnati's Brandon Vazquez. Reports also indicate that Gladbach sporting director Roland Virkus was in the U.S. over the international break to watch the American in action.

Vazquez played 37 times for Cincinnati last season, contributing eight assists along with 20 goals, and he's a part of the USMNT's future plans. If FC Cincinnati lose their star forward, they'll hope to delay it until the end of the year. If they can't hold off suitors over the summer, they'll potentially need to find a deal for a replacement in the middle of their MLS season.


'I like to do both!' - Scott McTominay sends 'more goals' message to Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag after bagging ANOTHER brace in historic Scotland win

Scotland hero Scott McTominay sent Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag a message after his brace helped beat Spain 2-0 on Tuesday.

After the match, a beaming McTominay admitted he relished both sides of midfield work, and believed his recent form evidenced his ability to add more to his game.

"For me, I've got to keep doing that, I know I can add more goals and assists to my game,  " Asked about arguably Scotland's biggest scalp under Steve Clarke, the Man Utd star added: "The manager said before the match that this was a chance to create our own legacy, these are the nights that in 20, 30 years everyone will remember and watch back and say 'I was there'. It's what the game's about, and we can't thank the fans enough.  McTominay's tally of four goals while on Scotland duty doubles his United total across all competitions this season, as his contributions thus far have largely come from the bench.

Chelsea set Mason Mount asking price amid Liverpool & Bayern transfer interest

Chelsea are due to sell Mason Mount this summer as contract negotiations continue to stall, and they've reportedly named their price.

Barcelona SLAMMED by Ansu Fati's father over forward's lack of playing time since inheriting Lionel Messi's No.10 shirt

Bori Fati feels his son deserves more playing time at Barcelona and has advised the 20-year-old to leave the club in the summer.

Fati's father has given an explosive interview regarding his son's situation at Barcelona. The 20-year-old has been unable to make an impact at Camp Nou this season and has not found the back of the net in La Liga since October in a 3-0 win over Villarreal.   following the Argentine's surprise departure in 2021, but has since struggled with a number of serious injuries and is yet to force his way back into the Barca starting XI. Bori Fati believes his son deserves more game time and is frustrated at the way he's being used by Xavi at Camp Nou. "As a father I am angry, yes, like any father. Because seeing Ansu play so little makes you a little angry. I tell them that we deserve much more. Ansu when he played before getting injured, there was Messi, [Luis] Suarez, [Ousmane] Dembele, [Antoine] Griezmann," he told  . "It bothers me that they give him a minute, two minutes or three minutes. The forwards that are there are phenomenal, but we are talking about Ansu Fati, from the Spanish national team, he is not just any boy. He's a boy who left La Masía. If you don't give him that, what are you going to give him? Ansu deserves much more, we're talking about Barcelona's '10.'" : Bori Fati also said he would be happy to see his son leave Barcelona, but made it clear the forward wants to continue at Camp Nou. "At Barca they tell me that they bet a lot on Ansu, they tell me that clearly. When I sat down with Jorge Mendes [his representative], the first thing he told me was that Ansu wants to stay and will continue playing for Barcelona. But I, as a father, thought otherwise, and Ansu doesn't agree with that," he added. "I think a lot about Sevilla, about going home. Right now I wouldn't value an offer from Madrid, because Ansu wouldn't accept it. I can't put Ansu where he doesn't want to go. But I will never speak ill of Madrid because they are two very big clubs and you never know what the world is going to bring you... You never know where it is going to take you."

They did three of four awards between the female Ballon d'Or and the men's Ballon d'Or.

'Still my job to pick the wine!' - Sir Alex Ferguson reflects on Arsene Wenger rivalry as Man Utd & Arsenal greats become first managers inducted into Premier League Hall of Fame

Sir Alex Ferguson has spoken about his old rival Arsene Wenger after both men were inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame.

The two legends of the game have become the first managers to be inducted into the Premier League's Hall of Fame in recognition of their achievements. Sir Alex and Wenger won 16 Premier League titles between them and enjoyed a longstanding rivalry. The former Manchester United boss is thrilled with the honour and opened up on his relationship with Wenger and how the two still meet up today. "I’m truly delighted to be inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame. It’s an honour when you receive recognition like this. However, it’s not just about me as a person. It’s about the job at Manchester United and the bond we had over many years, so I’m also proud for the club, the staff and my players," he said. "I feel Arsène is a very worthy inductee as he transformed Arsenal Football Club fantastically. They became a tough team to compete with and we both wanted to win, which motivated us further. Through the years since retirement, we’d go for dinner together in a little restaurant he knows well in Switzerland. He is a really interesting man and I enjoy his company, but it is still my job to pick the wine!” Wenger also had some warm words for Sir Alex when reacting to the Premier League's announcement, as he said: "I am very grateful to have been selected for the Premier League Hall of Fame. We always wanted to give something special to the fans and when you have players capable of remarkable things, the most important thing for me is the obligation of perfection. I’d like to be known as someone who loved Arsenal, who respected the values of the club and left it in a position where it can grow and become even bigger. To share this with Sir Alex is a great honour for me. It’s like two boxers, you fight like mad and go the distance together. At the end of the day, you have respect and it will be a great opportunity to meet with him, share a good bottle of wine and memories of our old battles." Two legends who helped define the Premier League. Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger are the first two inductees of the 2023    The rivalry between the two men has certainly mellowed since their days in charge of Manchester United and Arsenal. Wenger's arrival in north London saw the Gunners challenge Manchester United's dominance of the English game, with the Frenchman going to win three titles in his 22 seasons in charge. Tensions boiled over on the pitch on several occasions, peaking in 2004 with the notorious incident at Old Trafford when United ended Arsenal's 49-match unbeaten record and  . Sir Alex won the Premier League title on 13 occasions as Manchester United manager, nine more times than any other manager in Premier League history. Arsenal have not won the Premier League since their last title under Wenger in 2003-04 but are in a strong position to end that drought this season. The Gunners have an eight-point lead at the top of the table and return to action on Saturday, April 1 against Leeds United.

The 22-year-old shot-stopper is now back in favour, with Manchester City defender Esme Morgan also being recalled.

After these games, there will be less than three months until we fly to the tournament and we must make every second on and off the pitch count. For us as a technical staff this will be the last chance to see the players within our England environment before we come together for the final preparation phase in June. And these two matches will be two real tests to see where we are at.” She added on competing in the inaugural women’s Finalissima against Brazil at Wembley on April 6, with a   at the Brentford Community Stadium on April 11: “This is a major new trophy and to compete for it at a sold-out Wembley is another special moment, both for us as a team but also for our fans. We will never take these occasions for granted and I want to see how we perform against two teams that will be hoping to challenge for the World Cup.” Chelsea star Fran Kirby remains unavailable due to a knee problem that has kept her out since February, while Arsenal forward Beth Mead is still recovering from an ACL injury.


Come on, Carlo, take the Brazil job! Ancelotti should try to complete football when he leaves Real Madrid

The Italian has won every major trophy at club level - all that remains for him to achieve is a World Cup win

For some time now, Real Madrid's Brazil contingent have been joking with Carlo Ancelotti about him becoming their new boss at international level.  "They laugh about it,"   "But we haven't really talked about it. We're friends, they're jokes, they laugh. But the reality is different: I have a contract until 2024." The reality now, though, is that the Brazilian Football Federation (CBF) is deadly serious about appointing Ancelotti as the successor to Tite, who stepped down after the Selecao's shock quarter-final loss to Croatia at the 2022 World Cup.  And it's hard to think of a move that makes more sense in the world of football right now. 


Chelsea coach Anthony Barry told to stay AWAY from training as he aims to join Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich

Chelsea coach Anthony Barry has reportedly been told to stay away from the club’s training ground ahead of a potential reunion with Thomas Tuchel.

Former Blues boss Tuchel is now calling the shots at Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich, having been  , and he wants Barry to form part of his backroom team at the Allianz Arena.

'I have things I still want to accomplish' - USMNT star Tim Ream on why he could keep playing for another five years

The centerback may be 35 but he tells GOAL that he has no intention of calling time on his career any time soon

About an hour or so after the U.S. men's national team's run through the 2022 World Cup ended, Tim Ream took the time to reflect. While speaking with reporters, he expressed what the experience meant to him. He talked about his road to Qatar and how, for a while, he never thought his World Cup dream had come true. Ultimately it did, with Ream a pivotal figure for the USMNT. If that was it for him, if that was the pinnacle of his career, he said he could live with that. Now, nearly four months later, it appears that the 35-year-old's career is far from over. You could easily make the argument that Ream has never been better, with his spectacular World Cup form carrying over to Fulham's Premier League campaign. So, here he was, with the USMNT for the first real games of the 2023 cycle. It appears Qatar wasn't the final chapter, after all. "You just never know," Ream said. "Obviously, after the Netherlands game, you just don't know what is coming. I've maintained that I'm firmly just in that moment and, in that moment, you don't know what is or what could be." "What could be" is a key part of that because, on current form, there's a pretty good chance that Ream could still be the USMNT's starting centerback for some time. There's a Gold Cup this summer, a Copa America next and then, hey, the World Cup will be here before you know it. He was as composed as ever in his most recent USMNT appearance, the 1-0 win over El Salvador, as he partnered Miles Robinson with yet another rock-solid performance. Ream says he plans to remain at Craven Cottage for the foreseeable future. Despite his post-World Cup reflections, he believes he's far from finished. "I have things I still want to accomplish over in England," he said. "I have no plans to come back [to MLS]. I'm going to continue to push myself and play at the highest level that I possibly can because that's kind of who I am and what I want to do. "I want to keep keep testing myself. I want to keep pushing myself until I can't anymore. I've maintained that if at all possible, I'll retire playing over there. It's something that that I still have a hunger for." In recent months, Ream has been heavily linked with St. Louis City SC, MLS' newest expansion club. Ream grew up in St. Louis and has now etched his own place in the city's illustrious soccer history, which is only just now being illuminated by the arrival of an MLS side. Thus far, St. Louis City SC are unbeaten through their first five MLS games. The city is finally getting its due as a true soccer hotbed, with fans packing CITYPARK for a team that has, thus far, gotten off to a perfect start. Ream, like everyone from St. Louis, has watched on with pride and, even if he has no plans to join the club any time soon, he hopes to see what has been built in his city in the near future. "The games, just everything about it is impressive for an expansion team but not surprising, because I know what the city is like with the game and the passion."  "I'm hoping to stay involved in this [USMNT] group and, after we finish the season, we'll end up having camp pretty, pretty quickly, so I don't know when I'll get back, but I mean the atmosphere, I've seen it on the TV." He added: "You never know. I have so many connections back there that I can't say, but I'm still firmly, firmly believing that I can play another three, four, five years and, after that, we'll see what happens. Who knows where I ended up? I could end up anywhere at that point!" With the international break now over, Ream's focus will quickly return to Fulham. The club is set to visit Bournemouth this Saturday and, with only 11 matches left in the Premier League season, every point will count towards Fulham's playoff push. Much is left to be decided but, after seeming so close to the end of his international career on that night in Qatar, it seems there is no end in sight for a player that has plenty of big games left in the tank. "My career has been a lot of ups and downs and so I've learned to kind of just ride with it, to go with it," Ream said. "There's going to be disappointments along the way and, if you can come out on the other side of those disappointments a better player, a better person, then it's no problem. "I'm not going to be too up, I'm not going to be too down. I try to stay pretty, pretty even no matter what happens and it's put me in a good position so far and gotten me to this point. I'm going to continue that."


Argentina vs Curacao : Lineups and LIVE updates

With the carnival mood in Argentina still going strong, the world champions cap off their March homecoming on Tuesday with a friendly against Curacao

On the heels of their comfortable 2-0 win over Panama, the World Cup triumph tour for Lionel Messi and Argentina continues when they face CONCACAF underdogs Curacao at Estadio Unico in friendly action at the Santiago del Estero. Thiago Almada scored the opener in the 78th minute, while Lionel Messi starred in Argentina’s victory in Buenos Aires on Thursday, and scored a late free-kick goal and completed nine successful dribble attempts during the match.  That goal marked the 800th of his professional career for club and country, but he's not done scoring just yet. Now, the 35-year-old legend will try to score his 100th international goal in this encounter as the celebrations for the victory in Qatar continue. Curacao, ranked 85th in the world, troubled both Canada and Honduras in the CONCACAF Nations League, but finished bottom of Group C. They have never played Argentina in their nation's history, and given that CONCACAF will host the new 48-team 2026 World Cup, this could be a huge game to gauge their progress as they aim for qualification in four years' time. There's a huge gulf in quality between these two teams and if Argentina opened the scoring early on, they can run up a big scoreline. Expect this to be another festive atmosphere, celebrating Messi and his teammates accomplishments in Qatar. E.Martinez; Montiel, Otamendi, Acuna; Lo Celso, Fernandez, Mac Allister; Messi, La.

Arsenal 10 games from immortality: Mikel Arteta's men perfectly placed in final sprint for Premier League glory

The Gunners are eight points clear at the top of the Premier League table, putting them in an excellent position to win their first title since 2004

So, here it is, then, the home stretch. The international break is over and for Arsenal the cup competitions are done.  . The Gunners are effectively 10 matches away from immortality. It’s been 19 years since Arsenal were last crowned champions of England and they've not had a better chance to end that run over the past two decades. After a quite remarkable 28 games, they are eight points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table going into this weekend’s game against Leeds United. But now they are faced with arguably their toughest task to date: finishing off the job. Some, like Oleksandr Zinchenko, Gabriel Jesus and Jorginho, have been in this type of position before. But the majority haven’t, and nor has Arteta. Whether that makes a difference remains to be seen, but so far Arsenal have shown little sign of feeling the pressure. , many expected them to fall away. It was assumed that City would just go on and cruise to the title like they always do. But Arsenal won at Aston Villa the following weekend in dramatic fashion to return to the summit and have followed that up with a further five straight wins.


Chasing Manchester City has broken Liverpool - fixing the Reds will be Jurgen Klopp’s toughest task ever

The Reds have been the only ones to compete with Pep Guardiola's winning machine in recent years, but they've been left counting the cost

The clock may have said 11pm, the end of a long and tiring day of travel, but the mood in the passport queue at Liverpool John Lennon Airport was one of delight, happiness and celebration. This was May 4, 2022, and a group of Liverpool supporters, returning bleary-eyed to Merseyside having attended their side’s Champions League semi-final win over Villarreal, had landed to the best news imaginable.   They would not be joining the Reds in the final. Pep Guardiola’s side had blown their big chance. Again. “Straight to town, surely?” came the shout as news of City’s collapse in the Bernabeu spread through the queue. Outside, as Ubers and Delta taxis waited to collect, a chant began. The point of this story is not to remind City fans of their misery, or to poke fun at those Liverpool supporters for their premature celebrations – Real, after all, would go on to beat Jurgen Klopp’s side in the final.  Rather, it is to reflect upon the nature of this most modern of rivalries, and the manner in which the two clubs’ fortunes have been so intrinsically intertwined over the past few years...

Kai Havertz explains why his Chelsea team-mates call him 'Donkey' as he reveals 'special relationship' with 'very calm animal'

Chelsea forward Kai Havertz has opened up on his love for animals and how that has inspired a nickname for him at Stamford Bridge.

Havertz has spoken about his love for donkeys after launching a charity inspired by the animals, which also incorporates youth development and elderly care.

It’s not because of my football,” he told  . "From day one, I felt a special relationship with donkeys. It’s a very calm animal: maybe I personalised myself in them because I’m calm too. They chill all day, don’t do much, just want to live their life. I loved them always. And when I lost, I would go to the sanctuary. You look at the animals, see something human in them. It was a kind of recovery, a place I felt peace." Havertz added: "Football’s not the most important thing in my life. Other things are maybe 100 times more important. Maybe it’s not easy to say and people don’t like it, but it’s how I feel."  Chelsea are in the midst of a difficult season but Havertz hit form just before the international break. The Germany international has scored in each of his last three games for the Blues and now has seven for the season so far in the Premier League.

'People think you are Lionel Messi' - Kai Havertz opens up Chelsea transfer fee 'tension' & defends under-fire Graham Potter

Kai Havertz has opened on on the "tension" that came with his £72m transfer fee at Chelsea, claiming: "People think you are Lionel Messi."

The German playmaker was signed from  in September 2020, which was a club record at the time. Havertz has become a Champions League winner at Chelsea while recording 32 goals and 15 assists across all competitions, but he made a slow start to life at Stamford Bridge. The Germany international admits that his price tag was a burden as it created an immediate pressure to perform. The Chelsea forward told   “For me the price was a big thing. I was Chelsea’s most expensive player. I don’t understand how so much money is paid but it is normal in football: look at our recent transfers. That brings pressure because people think you are Messi. I was still 20, 21. People don’t see that; they see the price so you have to be great from day one. You can feel it, the tension. You read it, hear it. I came during Covid." Havertz added on how he deals with the weight of expectations: "You have to be stable. If you’re playing badly, it doesn’t make you the worst person on earth and the highs aren’t real. Everything moves fast: the last few months is a good example. Everyone’s upset with me, I don’t score, I play rubbish, this is bad, that’s bad, they have to sell me. Now I score and everyone says I am the best player. People love me now but maybe in two weeks they hate me again. No matter how well I played, I come home and my girlfriend wants me to put the plates into the dishwasher."  Havertz is not the only one dealing with pressure at Chelsea, with manager Graham Potter having also faced plenty of criticism after a tough first few months in charge since joining the club from Brighton. The Blues find themselves down in 10th spot in the Premier League with just 38 points from 27 matches, but Havertz insists the squad is fully behind the under-fire coach. "(He is) very good for Chelsea even though he gets criticism; in the changing room everyone knows his qualities," he said. Havertz will be in action when Chelsea host Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in a Premier League encounter.

Zara Kramzar: Roma's 'unique' record-breaking teen earning comparisons to Christine Sinclair

The first player born in 2006 to play in Serie A, Zara Kramzar is proving integral to her club's hopes of making history this season

There were 10 minutes left on the clock and Roma, chasing a first ever Serie A title for its women's team, had yet to break the deadlock against bottom club Sampdoria. So, h  turned to his bench and called over Zara Kramzar, a 17-year-old midfielder from Slovenia that few had heard of before her move to Italy last summer. Within five minutes, the substitution had paid off. Despite being on the floor in the box when   such was the pressure from the opposing defender, the teenager somehow managed to direct it into the back of the net to win the game. It was her most decisive contribution to the Roma cause yet. Slovenia may not be the first country you think of when you think of football. Its men's team has qualified for three major tournaments since becoming independent from Yugoslavia in 1991 but, having been knocked out in the group stages each time, is perhaps most famous for producing two of the best goalkeepers of recent years – Jan Oblak and Samir Handanovic. The women's team has yet to make a big international event. In fact, of the 17 major tournaments in the women's game since 1991, it didn't even enter the qualification process for six of them. There can be cautious optimism for the future, with Slovenia's current squad peppered with talents in their 20s who are playing in big European leagues, such as Sara Agrez, who represents two-time European champions Wolfsburg, and Lara Prasnikar, a prolific goalscorer for Eintracht Frankfurt. But in Kramzar, Slovenia doesn't just have another great player who can play in a top team. Despite the country's lack of success on the biggest stage, it appears to have a talent who could go on to achieve whatever she desires.

The evolution of laceless football boots: design, market leaders and more

17 years of innovation and a lot more to come 

When adidas released its laceless ACE 16+ Purecontrol at the start of 2016, the hype train began immediately. Headlines praised the “world’s first laceless boot” and saluted adidas for its innovations. In reality, though,  had already existed for a decade, launched by Italian bootmaker Lotto in 2006. The Lotto Zhero Gravity was a game-changing design, although its impact wasn’t felt at the time. It was worn by  ,  , and   – showing how important Lotto thought the innovation was – and briefly caused a stir in 2006. The benefits of the Zhero Gravity, however, were overlooked, and it would be a full ten years before laceless boots established themselves as an important part of the football world. The ACE 16+ Purecontrol began a love affair with laceless boots that  . The German manufacturer is still the only major brand that released all of its silhouettes in laceless form, while some of its competitors – namely Nike – have yet to launch their first boot without laces. When adidas first teased the laceless design, the brand’s then-VP of Design, Sam Handy, described it as “the purest possible expression of a football boot.” In that same interview  , Handy went on to explain the 24-month process of designing and creating the shoe. “We have had to modify and adjust for different player types, and we have kept the needs of the world’s best footballers at the forefront of the entire process,” he said. The result was a boot with “everything you need, and nothing you don’t need.” After the arrival of the ACE 16+ Purecontrol, innovations came thick and fast in the laceless world. adidas returned with the X17+ Purespeed, complete with a fish scale style upper, in 2017, before   merged the forward-thinking laceless designs with footballing heritage a year later. Dubbed the Medusae Elite 3 and weighing just 170 grams, the British label’s new boot was the first ever laceless silhouette constructed from leather (most had gone for a knit texture in the past). It also came in a classic black and white colourway, guaranteeing to keep footballing purists happy despite the modern innovation at its heart.  Since then, adidas has established itself as the dominant force in laceless boots. While so far this year, the brand has focused on  , it has managed to incorporate its laceless technology. The Predator Accuracy, which launched earlier this month, comes in a laceless construction, allowing more space for the High Definition Grip rubber elements that run across the upper, giving more control and accuracy for the wearer. Other notable laceless boots from adidas have included 2019’s COPA 19+ – constructed from the classic K Leather as the brand reinvented one of its best-loved silhouettes, which used K Leather – and the  , which came with a lightweight design to add speed. It’s not just the Three Stripes, though. Nowadays, laceless boots are made by some of the other big-name football brands.  , which is designed for attacking players and is the brand’s key laceless style, while PUMA recently launched the   silhouette. All of the boots made by adidas, New Balance and PUMA tout the same benefits for laceless boots: more control and more accuracy.  There’s one major boot brand missing from that list. Even now, Nike are yet to enter the laceless boot market, although recent releases have shown that there could be something on the way. The brand has scrapped laceless for some of its junior silhouettes – most notably the Nike Jr. Superfly Pro and Nike Jr. Vapor 15 Academy – both of which show how laceless Nike boots could look one day. The traditional lacing system is replaced by pull tabs and crisscrossing straps, with Nike emphasising how easy they are to put on and how quickly you can get on the pitch. At the elite level, Nike also has been testing the water in recent years, most notably through its Phantom line. With the Phantom VSN that launched in 2020 and the Phantom GX design that came at the end of 2022, Nike covered the laces using the Ghost Lace System, which conceals the laces underneath a cover. This covering section adds more control by creating a smoother and larger area for striking the ball. Through its use of the Ghost Lace System, Nike may be acknowledging the benefits of laceless boots while also showing that you don’t have to get rid of the laces entirely. And what about Lotto, the brand that started it all? The Italian brand is showing how far ahead of the curve it was and continuing to honour the original Zhero Gravity. In 2021, Lotto released a new take on the innovative silhouette, updating it for modern football. The laceless upper stayed the same, but the brand added a lightweight and modern outsole designed for more flexibility. It also continues to carry the laceless torch with its Solista line of silhouettes. When Lotto launched the Zhero Gravity 17 years ago, it hoped to revolutionise football boot design. It took a little longer than the brand expected – and with adidas taking on the mantle – but laceless boots are now an integral part of the footballing world, and even Nike appears to be adapting to the change.

Quizzed on whether he could reach three figures before calling it a day, England captain Kane told  : “Getting 100 will be tough for sure, but I never count out anything. I am still young, I am 29, I am still fit and strong. I want to play for England for as long as I can. Every game there is I will be putting myself forward to try to play. We will take it step by step. The next step will be trying to get into the 60s. A hundred is not out of the question, it will be extremely tough but we will have to see how the next few years go.” Kane is rightly proud of all that he has achieved with England, saying of standing alone at the top of a notable goal chart: “I am extremely passionate about my country, I love playing for England. Even when I was younger, England was everything to me, watching them growing up. To be in that company now. To think of all the English legends and strikers that have played the game and to be No 1 now is just beyond my dreams. Playing for England is special and to have this record is special. I don't think I dreamt this far. I dreamt of playing for England and scoring for England – to be record goalscorer was not even in my dreams. I have had so many great moments and hopefully there are more to come.” England will not be action again until facing Malta and North Macedonia in June, with Kane heading back to Premier League duty with Spurs as   – with the likes of Manchester United and  .

'Antonio Conte clashes with everyone!' - Sacked Spurs manager's 'severe' character 'leaves you sleepless', says Christian Vieri

Antonio Conte is "accustomed to clashing with everyone", according to Christian Vieri, who was not surprised to see the Italian sacked by Tottenham.

A wild rant   after a disappointing 3-3 draw at Southampton led to Conte being dismissed by Spurs at the weekend. Speculation over the 53-year-old's future had raged throughout his second season in north London as he struggled to deliver consistent results while dodging questions over his contract.

In an interview with  the former Italy striker said: "Antonio is accustomed to clashing with everyone, it’s his character. If a club hires him, they should not expect someone happy with anything, but they know he is a severe and exigent person. It’s heavy to have him at a club, he leaves you sleepless. There are coaches like him and Jose Mourinho who are like hammers and demand the best from everyone at all times. And then there are those who are happy with anything. Everyone has his view.” After Conte's exit was made public, Tottenham forward Dejan Kulusevski came out in  .

Conte left Tottenham  "The club supported him a lot with it and everyone is close to each other but then we arrive in this mutual agreement, and I think the decision that we made was the right decision for everyone," the Spurs chief told  Stellini was in charge of the team when Conte was recovering from gallbladder surgery earlier in the season. Paratici has thrown his weight behind the new manager while refusing to be drawn on speculation over Conte's long-term successor, with Mauricio Pochettino, Julian Nagelsmann and Luis Enrique currently being linked with the job. He added: "Cristian managed the team when Antonio was sick this season and was good. Ryan Mason can help him a lot. He knows everything about this club and group of players. We are really, really, really confident that these two people can do a very, very good job. "We do not speak about other coaches or follow the speculation in the media because it is just speculation. We are focused. We are now concentrating on helping Cristian and helping the staff, Ryan, and the players."

Liverpool eyeing Evan Ndicka on free transfer with Eintracht Frankfurt defender set to leave Germany in summer

Liverpool are reportedly eager to sign Eintracht Frankfurt's Evan Ndicka on a free transfer, with the defender set to leave the club in the summer.

The Frenchman reportedly turned down a final extension offer from the Bundesliga outfit, which has alerted a number of top European clubs. According to the Liverpool are looking to steal a march on the likes of Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona in the race for Ndicka. The Reds are closely monitoring the development of the towering centre-back, who won the Europa League last season and also impressed in the Champions League this season before Eintracht's round of 16 loss to Napoli.

'This is not football' - Rodri BLASTS Scotland's 'rubbish' style of play after Spain suffer huge upset at Hampden

Spain midfielder Rodri has criticised Scotland's "rubbish" tactics after being on the end of a shock 2-0 defeat in Euro 2024 qualifying.

Two goals from   handed   in a European Championship qualifying clash on Tuesday. New Spain manager Luis de la Fuente made eight changes to his team, after   last time out, but saw his side slip to an embarrassing defeat as Scotland picked up their first win over Spain since 1984. Manchester City star Rodri wasn't happy with the home side's tactics at Hampden, though, and accused them of time-wasting to see out the victory. "It's the way they play, in the end you have to respect it, but for me it's a bit rubbish. It's always wasting time, they provoke you, they always fall. This for me is not football," he told   after the game. "The referee says nothing and it's a bit frustrating because we want to win. It's difficult, because they waste time. But they have their weapons, and we will learn for the next time." Rodri did, however, admit his team should have been better in possession and lamented their failure to find the back of the net. "We wanted to go in the duels and the battles. We always fight, but this is not about fighting, it's about wasting time, it's about four or five players falling to the floor, those kinds of situations," he added. "These teams are always physically strong, but we have to use our weapons. We are good with the ball and have to move the ball quickly. Today we did many good things, but we didn't score." The result leaves Spain three points adrift of Group A leaders Scotland but still second in the standings. De la Fuente's decision to rest players such as Gavi, Alejandro Balde and Dani Olmo backfired as he becomes the first Spain boss to lose his first away game in charge since  . Spain have lost a game by a margin of 2+ goals for the first time since June 2016 against Italy in the European Championship finals (0-2), and for the first time in Euro qualification since October 2006 to Sweden. Spain's next Euro qualifier is not until September against Georgia. Before then, La Roja take on Italy in the semi-finals of the Nations League in June.

Explained: Why France's best players have refused to play at the Women's World Cup 2023

Wendie Renard, Marie-Antoinette Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani have all said they won't play in Australia and New Zealand. Why?

Under normal circumstances, France would head to the Women's World Cup this summer as one of the favourites to lift the trophy, such is the vast amount of talent they have available. However, just five months out from the tournament kicking off in Australia and New Zealand, captain  , with star names Marie Antoinette-Katoto and Kadidiatou Diani following suit soon after. Their decisions raised serious questions about the French Football Federation (FFF) and head coach Corinne Diacre,  It also made France the third nation ranked in FIFA's top seven to be facing a rather public dispute between the players and the federation in a World Cup year,   and  . . So, will France have all the players they want available for the 2023 Women's World Cup?  has everything you need to know about what is unfolding with the France women's national team. Renard, an eight-time European champion with Lyon, was the first to announce that she would not play at this summer's World Cup. "I have defended the blue, white and red shirt 142 times with passion, respect, commitment and professionalism,"  . "I love France more than anything else, I am not perfect, far from it, but I can no longer support the current system which is far from the requirements of the highest level. "It is a sad day but necessary to preserve my mental health. It is with a heavy heart that I come to inform you of my decision to step back from the French team. I will unfortunately not be playing in this World Cup in such conditions. "My face may hide the pain but my heart is suffering... and I don't want to suffer anymore. Thank you for your support and for respecting my decision." Merci pour votre soutien et le respect de ma décision. 🇫🇷  Diani and Katoto, two of the best forwards in world football, followed. "Following the statement of our captain Wendie Renard and in view of the recent results and management of the French team, I announce that I am suspending my international obligations in order to concentrate on my club career,"  . "I am the first fan of the French team and if the necessary changes are finally made, I will return to the service of the French shirt." "The words of our captain Wendie lead me in my turn to talk about the situation in the France team,"  . "The events of 2019, the injury of 2022 then the recent events show me that I am no longer adequate with the management of the France team and the values transmitted. "I therefore take the decision to put my international career on hold until the necessary changes are applied." Katoto's mention of 2019 referred to Diacre's decision not to call her up to the home World Cup, despite her finishing as the top goal-scorer in the French league that season. Griedge Mbock Bathy, the France defender who is currently out injured, also shared a statement in which she expressed "solidarity" with her team-mates. "It is above all a cry from the heart which I hope will be heard,"  . ✊🏾✊🏾  This was not the first time there was controversy under Diacre's reign. Eugenie Le Sommer, France's all-time leading scorer, was surprisingly omitted from her Euro 2022 squad, as was Amandine Henry. Henry had been named Player of the Match in the Women's Champions League final only nine days earlier. "It just doesn’t add up," the midfielder told  . She was last called up to play for France by Diacre in November 2020. Sarah Bouhaddi, the PSG goalkeeper who won eight Champions League titles with Lyon, also retired from international duty while Diacre was in charge. “Winning a title with this coach seems impossible to me," she said. Neither Katoto nor Renard explicitly pointed the finger at any one person as to why they were withdrawing from selection. However, as the comments from Bouhaddi show, unrest appears to have been bubbling under for some time. Renard, for example, was previously stripped of the captaincy back in 2017. Diacre said that her level was not high enough, in a year when the defender won the league title, the Champions League and was named to the FIFPRO World XI. In her book,  , Renard said she had suffered from the "rejection and brutality" of the coach. Despite all of these situations, though, Diacre remained. It's not just about the coach, either. Gaetane Thiney, Paris FC's veteran midfielder, gave an interview to   magazine in 2021 in which she explained that the 2015 Women's World Cup "completely broke her", which asked questions of the federation as a whole. Noel Le Graet, the president of the FFF from 2011, has reportedly backed Diacre strongly throughout her tenure, but he is currently facing allegations of sexual harassment and stepped down from his role on February 28, 2023. He denies the allegations. On March 9,  , with the FFF describing the dysfunctions between players and coach as "irreversible". During that broadcast it emerged that Diani was unhappy about the lack of professionalism in Les Bleues' set-up - specifically highlighting an absence of specialist coaching and adequate medical care. "Aujourd'hui, je me sens plutôt bien. Notre capitaine Wendie Renard a décidé de prendre la parole. C'est très courageux de sa part et je pense qu'en tant que cadre il était vraiment important de la soutenir." Kadidiatou Diani sur sa mise en retrait des Bleues    "In the beginning, you had to be injured to qualify for a massage or treatment session like you would have in a club," she said. "The FFF must make changes. We raised a cry of alarm. We expressed our feelings. I think they will study our case and take all this seriously to move our team forward. "I think we've reached a point of no return. So, here, for me, if we want to talk about a breakup, then I'll talk about a breakup. I think it's important to have something new because the girls just can't take it anymore. "I find that we lack professionalism in the France team. Today, we find ourselves with a fairly small staff. It's the coach who decides on her staff," she added.  "We don't have an assistant coach, no specific 'attacking' coach, I'm talking about that because I'm an attacker and it’s true that sometimes I would like to work in front of the goal." . He had already taken a step back from his role amid the allegations of sexual harassment and the resulting legal investigation. Philippe Diallo, vice-president, will act as interim president of the FFF until June 10, 2023, which is the date of the next federal assembly. On March 8,  . "For over ten days, I’ve been the subject of a smear campaign which is astonishing in its violence and dishonesty," she said. However, just a day later,  .  . Henry, Katoto and Diani were all unavailable for selection due to injury but the coach was asked about the former two and spoke well of both. He described Henry as a player "likely to be shortlisted for the World Cup" and said that he plans to meet Katoto in the next few days.

'Very unfortunate' - Chelsea captain Magdalena Eriksson 'doesn't understand' why FIFA wouldn't allow OneLove armbands at Women's World Cup

Chelsea captain Magdalena Eriksson has said it would be "very unfortunate" if FIFA opted to ban OneLove armbands at the Women's World Cup. 

The armbands - which feature rainbow colours -  , and recent reports have suggested that football's governing body is yet to make a decision on whether they will be permitted in Australia and New Zealand this summer. Speaking before Chelsea's Champions League clash with Lyon on Thursday, Eriksson revealed that she would be in favour of the OneLove armbands making a return for the World Cup. "It’s very unfortunate. We’ve been clear in the women’s game that we want to wear it as captains - a lot of national teams have come out and said it. I don’t understand the decision. Hopefully we can raise our voices together and change it," she said. A final verdict is yet to be made on the armbands' use, with FIFA releasing the following statement on the issue: "FIFA wishes to reiterate that no decision has been taken in relation to armbands. FIFA remains committed to ongoing dialogue with players and member associations." The Blues skipper will be hoping to help her side protect their one-goal led from the first leg against Lyon and progress to the Champions League semi-finals.

Man Utd takeover bidder Thomas Zilliacus claims to have GAME-CHANGING revenue source that Glazer family missed

Manchester United takeover bidder Thomas Zilliacus claims to have a game-changing revenue source up his sleeve that the Glazer family has missed.

Formal offers for the Premier League heavyweights are on the table at Old Trafford, with the Glazers – who have   throughout an eventful reign in England – looking to generate around £6 billion ($7m) from a sale. It has been revealed that  , with revenue down 10 per cent in United’s latest financial results, but Zilliacus claims to have a money-making plan that he will unveil if his bid for ownership proves to be successful. Zilliacus has posted in a series of tweets: “The latest financial figures released by Manchester United show the club has missed one revenue source that could bring in more money than any of the current ones. If XXI Century Capital's bid wins that will change.” He added: “Many have asked what additional source of revenue I am talking about. I will reveal what it is if I am successful with my bid, and immediately implement it.” Zilliacus – who is the chairman and founder of novaM Group, Mobile FutureWorks and XXI Century Capital – has vowed to make United supporters central to his plans, claiming that he will sell half of the club to fans in the form of shares and allow them to vote on important club matters via an app. Zilliacus is, however, not the only runner in the race for United, with   – who is Britain’s richest man – also in contention   and U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management.

Ansu Fati upset that father ripped Barcelona without informing him rant was coming, with winger discovering controversy from bed

Ansu Fati has not taken kindly to the strong words given by his father Bori, which slammed current employers Barcelona and urged his son to move on.

Fati's father gave an explosive with   in the early hours of Wednesday morning claiming  , which, he claimed, is lower than the days when Lionel Messi was around (even though the player is set to break his personal best for La Liga appearances).

'I should have shown more' - Son Heung-min sends honest message to Antonio Conte following Tottenham sacking

Tottenham forward Son Heung-min admitted he "felt responsible" for Antonio Conte's sacking as he felt he "should have done more" this season.

Spurs announced the inevitable on Sunday when they revealed the Italian had   with ten Premier League games still to play. While Son finished as last season's joint-top scorer in the league with 23 goals, he has struck just six times this campaign, performances which he felt guilty for in light of Conte's sacking. I should have shown more but I couldn't. I couldn't help the team and I feel responsible as he left the club. He surely has great ability and experience as a coach and I'm sure he'll have great success in his other career." Son's message to Conte comes despite the Italian publicly outing his players, something which drew a   not long after the tirade.

Ex-Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich secretly pumped £103 MILLION into Dutch club Vitesse while at Stamford Bridge

Dutch club Vitesse received €117 million (£103m/$127m) in loans from then-Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, a recent report has found.

That's according to exclusive information from  , which write that Abramovich played a key part in funding the Vitesse takeover of 2010, which was headed by former Georgia international Merab Jordania. The findings, which stem from a cache of leaked data known as the Oligarch files, appear to show that the secret backing flowed through several entities   notes that Vitesse had already been on the radar of the Netherlands football association over their alleged relationship with Abramovich. Jordania was a reported friend of the oligarch, and was succeeded by his associate and Russian businessman Alexander Chigirinsky. Vitesse also became a "partner club" to Chelsea and took in many of their loanees from 2010 onwards, with Nemanja Matic and Mason Mount - as recently as 2017-18 - two standout examples. However, the offshore havens utilised by Abramovich were,   writes, so opaque as to evade Dutch authorities on two occasions. Now, it has come to light  "On Wednesday afternoon, the British newspaper The Guardian came out with a publication claiming that Vitesse was indirectly funded by companies owned by Mr. Abramovich, the then owner of Chelsea, in the period between 2010 and 2016," the club responded in a statement. "Vitesse stresses that the information on which the article is based was never known to the club. The club has always cooperated fully with the investigations launched by the KNVB, which also did not reveal any illegalities. "Vitesse received share premium payments from the holding company above the club during the said period, which is also evident from all published annual reports. This holding company was, as The Guardian writes, financed by Marindale Trading Limited. Mr. Chigirinskiy is the (sole) beneficial owner of Marindale Trading Limited, which is evident from the official documents that have been part of the investigations. Vitesse had no knowledge of how this company was financed. Nor did Vitesse itself have any loan agreements." The KNVB and other experts have investigated the situation at Vitesse broadly and thoroughly on several occasions; first the structure surrounding the takeover (2010), then the accuracy and completeness of the legal structures and financing structure presented by Vitesse (2015)," continued Vitesse. "At all times, Vitesse gave the investigators full access to all relevant documents in its possession. Both investigations did not reveal any facts in violation of KNVB and UEFA rules (see this article). "It was concluded at the time that Vitesse had always correctly and fully informed parties about the club's ownership and legal structure, that Vitesse's legal structure was in line with KNVB regulations and that no third party had control of the club. This is also confirmed in The Guardian by a representative of Chelsea." The ramifications are unknown as yet, although

'A reality I’ve hid' - USMNT & MLS midfielder Sebastian Lletget says he was extorted after cheating on fiancee Becky G

USMNT and MLS midfielder Sebastian Lletget claimed this week that he was the victim of an extortion attempt after he cheated on fiancee Becky G.

Lletget, who has made 33 USMNT appearances, spoke publicly about the situation for the first time via Instagram. He admitted to cheating on the famous singer and said he was forced to go public after "a 10 minute lapse in judgment resulted in an extortion plot."  It's unclear whether the infidelity occurred before or after their December engagement, or the exact threats that were made against him. He began dating Becky G, a world-famous musical artist, in 2016. "Over the last several weeks, during a moment I regret deeply, a 10 minute lapse in judgment resulted in an extortion plot,"  . "Since this person did not get what they wanted it has now become a public social media spectacle filled with more lies than any truth and false posts aimed at the love of my life, the one person who I should never take for granted or put at risk. "While this anonymous internet stalker – who I never met, unlike they claimed - had an ultimate goal that was not clear, for me it has been a wake-up call. The loudest alarm of my life. I can't keep running from demons. I know that any actions made that put us here should have never happened to begin with. Pushing right up to the very boundaries of lines that should never be crossed only hurts me and the people I love most." Lletget also apologized to Becky G for his actions, adding: "To Becky, you have been the light in my life, my strength, who has always shown me unconditional love," he added. "Instead of honoring that love every day, I have done the opposite, hurting you, and disrespecting the one person I love more than anything. I am so sorry and know I have to do whatever it takes to earn back the trust and love you deserve." The 30-year-old moved to FC Dallas from the New England Revolution last year after first making his name with the LA Galaxy. He featured early in USMNT qualifying for the 2022 World Cup but fell out of Gregg Berhalter's plans as the tournament approached. No criminal investigation into the alleged extortion attempt has been announced. "This past week of chaos & pain has forced me to face the consequences of my actions, my fears & my lapses from the past," Lletget wrote. "I have half-heartedly been participating in therapy, knowing I have deeply rooted anger and mental health issues that require the same commitment and treatment that I devote to my physical well-being. If I am to be the man I aspire to be, I have to do better. I have decided to commit myself to a mental wellness program to work on the parts of me that deeply need healing."


Tottenham dealt blow in Julian Nagelsmann pursuit as German wants break before next job amid Real Madrid & PSG uncertainty

Tottenham's hopes of landing Julian Nagelsmann have been dashed as the ex-Bayern Munich boss reportedly wants to wait before deciding his next move.
